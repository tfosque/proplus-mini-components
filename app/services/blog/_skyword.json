            "body": "<p>People worldwide are working to solve an important question: how can we clean up air pollution? To aid in this effort, roofing companies are now bringing environmental solutions to the global stage. For example, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454381/3m-smog-reducing-granules/\">TIME Magazine</a> included 3M Smog-Reducing Granules on its list of the best inventions of 2018<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454381/3m-smog-reducing-granules/\"></a> in the Sustainability and Social Good category.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Because the next generation of roofing customers is showing more and more that they care about protecting the environment, roofing contractors should consider how to incorporate these smog-reducing granules into their next project.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 class=\"\">The Roofing Customers of the Future Are Going Green</h2> \n<p></p> \n<p>According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/deloitte-millennial-survey.html\">2019 Deloitte Global Millennial Survey</a>, which asks millennials and Gen Zers about global societal challenges and their personal concerns, young adults' top concern is climate change, including the increased risk of natural disasters and the need to preserve our natural environment. The survey found that 29% of respondents cited climate change as a worry.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p> Currently, millennials are the largest age group employed in the US workforce, and as of 2018, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48259-millennials-have-officially-entered-the-housing-market/\">Housing Wire</a> reports they own 45% of US homes<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48259-millennials-have-officially-entered-the-housing-market/\"></a>. That means more and more of your future roofing clients will fall into this age group, and with climate as their top motivator, they're going to want to explore green home options.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Smog-Reducing Granules on Shingles</h2> \n<p></p> \n<p>When roofing contractors meet with the next generation about a new roof, the conversation is going to be about a lot more than just color choices. These customers are going to want to know how their roof will hold up in natural disasters, and how they can choose materials and techniques that reduce its environmental impact.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Smog-reducing granules could be a game changer for differentiating an asphalt shingle sale and installation. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.3m.com/3m-smog-reducing-roofing-granules-are-among-times-best-sustainability-social-good-inventions\">3M</a>, \"The smog-reducing granules harness the power of the sun to turn roofing shingles into a pollution-fighting surface. When the sun hits the granules, their photocatalytic coating transforms the smog pollution (nitrogen oxides) into water-soluble ions that safely wash away with rain. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory testing validated the photocatalytic materials used can reduce smog and contribute to cleaner air.\"</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Making Your Roofing Company Stand Out</h2> \n<p></p> \n<p>Offering cutting-edge technology and green options can help differentiate a roofing company. Local groups such as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cleanairleaders.com/\">Monterey Bay Air Resources District</a> award area businesses for their leadership in local air quality improvement. Winning and displaying an award like this prominently on your business website can help drive leads from interested customers who are impressed with your care for the community.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://malarkeyroofing.com/blog/detail/california-roofing-contractor-earns-air-quality-leadership-award-with-malarkey-smog-reducing-roofing-shingles\">Premo Roofing Company</a>, a past winner of the Monterey groups's Clean Air Leaders Award, calculated that its roofers install two smog-reducing roofs every week. Since each roof reduces the nitrogen oxide pollution of roughly two trees, and the company works 52 weeks per year, \"That is equivalent to roughly 260 acting trees helping clean the air in our communities across the Monterey Bay annually.\"</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This form of activism is what customers are going to be looking for from their roofing contractors. Although smog-reducing granule shingles are not yet available in every region, there is growing support in California and large cities across the US, as well as globally, for this type of solution. The use of smog-reducing granules in roofing will only continue to grow as the next generation of consumers demand it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>So, how can we clean up air pollution? By doing our part to ensure the materials and processes we use benefit not only our customers' homes, but also the environment they live in.</p> \n<p></p>",

            "title": "How to Generate Roofing Leads With Search Engine Marketing",
            "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you ever wondered how to land your business website on the first page of Google results? The first-page rank is the ultimate goal every small business strives toward but few achieve. One way companies gain this coveted placement — and use it to generate roofing leads — is to employ search engine marketing, or SEM.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is SEM?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before we dive into how to get to the first page, let's look at what SEM is.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Search engine marketing is the ability to gain traffic and visibility from search engines with both paid and unpaid efforts. SEM is the umbrella term for similar strategies like SEO (search engine optimization) and PPC (pay per click) marketing. While you can pursue results on any search engine, most businesses focus on Google.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a roofing contractor, you have up to four locations on the first page of Google results where your business can be featured to help customers find you.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Google Local Service Ads</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is one of Google's newest additions to the first page of service-based business search queries. It requires businesses to pay Google per lead instead of per click. That means you <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads\">only pay for potential customers</a>, not for every person who clicks on your website. This form of lead generation rolled out for select markets in 2015 and is now nationally available (with some limits).</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you aren't seeing these ads in your area, there's a catch: At least three validated contractors per market must qualify before ads are displayed. Once three businesses apply and are accepted into the program, your business listing will become active. Once activated, this is by far the easiest way to generate leads for your company.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Google Search Ads</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) has developed into a complicated platform where you can quickly spend thousands of dollars if you don't know how to set up an ad campaign with all the correct details (like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/mastering-geo-targeted-landing-pages-for-local-seo/\">geo-targeting, keyword optimization</a> and proper landing pages). </p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">One solution is to hire a reliable agency to ensure your campaign is properly set up and driving leads. Google awards certain active, experienced agencies Premier Partner status to highlight their skills. Look for this badge if you're considering hiring an outside company to help manage your web presence.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Google My Business</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google My Business is also known as the Map Pack within Google's first-page display. Business listings used to be a way for users to get directions to a physical business. Now, expanded listings let business owners share details that help customers learn more about the business before even visiting their website. </p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of these items include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Business website.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Phone number.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Directions and hours.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Photos.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Reviews from past customers.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Frequently asked questions.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Offers, events, articles and more.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Organic Search Results</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Appearing on the first page of Google is what many roofing business owners think of when they say they want first-page placement. Although this is a critical location to be listed within search engine results pages (SERPs), it is no longer the only option. Historically, there were up to 15 slots for websites to be showcased on the first page, but now some search results include so many diverse results (with other features <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/101-google-answer-boxes-a-journey-into-the-knowledge-graph\">like answer boxes</a>) that only seven slots remain. </p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Organic placement — for example, being the first search result for \"Madison local roofers\" — is enviable, but hard to achieve. Working to have a fast-loading website, great user experience, strong links and a strategy to retain the top placement are other critical priorities. Part of that strategy for placement in SERPs might be publishing strong content, since factors like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brightedge.com/blog/serp-serps-must-knows\">domain authority and a low bounce rate</a> help you rank higher. If you have a first-page rank for key search queries, this will help ensure your Google My Business listing will remain at the top of the Map Pack.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">With four places to win on the first page of Google, it's no wonder why even small roofing companies are throwing more efforts into SEM. True search engine marketing will allow you to drive leads quickly to your sales pipeline and gradually build up your web presence.</p>",

            "title": "What Is Roofing Underlayment? What Every Homeowner Needs to Know",
            "body": "<p>When it comes to your roof, beauty is more than skin-deep. Although the <a href=\"http://www.roofcenter.com/Residential_Roofing_Products.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shingles or tiles</a> might be the only part of the roof that you can see, there's much more to your roof than the surface.</p> \n<p>Beneath the shingles is a material called the underlayment. What is roofing underlayment? It's a material that rests between the shingles and the decking of the roof. Although you can't see this layer, it plays an important role.</p> \n<h2>What Is Roofing Underlayment For?</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.everybodyneedsaroof.com/Glossary/Details/737/Underlayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Roofing Contractors Association</a> (NRCA) calls underlayment a \"sheet material installed between a roof deck and roof covering.\" It's common on steep slope roofs, where it helps the roof shed water more efficiently and provides an extra layer of protection against weather damage. A steep slope is defined as a roof pitch above 3:12, or three inches of vertical rise for every 12 inches of horizontal run.</p> \n<p>You can think of the underlayment as the backup system for the shingles: If they leak, the underlayment is there to keep water from getting into your home or damaging to your roof's structure.</p> \n<p>Underlayment also helps to protect the roof during the installation process. Your roofing contractor will most likely install the underlayment right after the roof decking. If it rains or snows between the time the contractor installs the underlayment and the time they install the shingles, the underlayment will help to keep the structure of the roof dry.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Common Types of Roofing Underlayment</h2> \n<p>Roofing underlayment can be made from a variety of materials and is available in several weights. A roofing contractor will choose the type of underlayment to install based on the slope of the roof, the type of weather your area experiences and the type of shingles you've chosen.</p> \n<p>The most common underlayment for homes is asphalt-saturated felt. This black, fabric-like material can be made of a fiberglass or cellulose fiber base, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/underlayment-types.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Association of Certified Home Inspectors</a> (InterNACHI). The <a href=\"http://www.everybodyneedsaroof.com/asphalt-shingles#underlay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NRCA</a> explains that asphalt-saturated felt is available in two weights: No. 15 (Type I) for lighter roofing materials such as asphalt shingles, or No. 30 (Type II) for heavier materials such as clay tiles. </p> \n<p>The slope of the roof and the material of the shingles determines what weight is best and how much underlayment you need. While underlayment is protective, it's not completely waterproof — two layers of underlayment are often recommended for roofs that have a low pitch, while one layer is appropriate for steeper roofs.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Questions to Ask Your Contractor About Roofing Underlayment</h2> \n<p>Choosing the right contractor for the job is an important part of the process of getting a new roof. Along with asking your contractor questions about their experience and license, you'll want to talk to them about the materials they use and how those products work. Here are a few questions worth asking about underlayment:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>What type of materials do you use</strong>? Although asphalt-saturated felt is the most popular underlayment material, there may be reasons to install an alternative. Synthetic underlayments are even better at resisting moisture than asphalt-saturated felt, but according to InterNACHI and the NRCA, there aren't any American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for synthetic materials. This can mean extra steps when it comes to making sure your home is up to code.</li> \n <li><strong>What weight do you use and how many layers will you install</strong>? The NRCA recommends a minimum of one layer of underlayments for a roof with a slope of 4:12, and notes that No. 30 is more appropriate for heavier roofing materials. After you've asked your contractor what weight they plan on using and how many layers they'll install, ask them why they made that choice.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you're talking to roofing contractors, you might notice that you get different answers to your questions. Give your contractors a chance to explain their recommendations before you choose the one that seems like the best fit for you and your new roof.</p>",

            "title": "Tile Roof vs. Shingles: Benefits and Challenges for Roofing Contractors",
            "body": "<p>For residential roofing contractors, offering different types of roofing systems is becoming increasingly important. One material to consider is clay tile.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Understanding the different challenges of selling and installing a tile roof vs. shingles will require training for your crews and sales team, but it has the potential to boost the sales and profitability of a residential roofing business. Exploring the different types of clay tiles and systems will help you make the leap to offering another durable roofing option to customers.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2>Tile Durability and Price</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Most homes in the United States, outside of California and Florida, have shingles. In comparing a tile roof vs. shingles on a global scale, you'll find that tile is more popular worldwide. Tile has been in use for centuries more than modern asphalt shingles.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://tileroofing.org/why-tile/facts-tile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tile Roofing Industry Alliance</a> (TRI), tile roofing offers substantial durability, energy cost savings and proven performance. Tile is available in a large selection of colors, shapes and sizes that suit any architectural style, from Spanish Colonial and Mediterranean to Art Deco or contemporary. Tile also maintains its color through age-old processes like kiln firing, with some clay roof tile manufacturers guaranteeing their tiles won't fade for 50 years.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When it comes to extreme weather, tile can withstand high winds. The tiles' weight keeps them in place, and testing has shown that they can withstand winds of over 100 miles per hour (perfect for areas like Miami-Dade County whose building codes have a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://myguardianroofer.com/residential/metal-tile/\">high uplift requirement</a>). Tile systems also carry some of the strongest fire ratings in the industry, protecting against urban blazes and wildfires.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>From a sustainability standpoint, clay tile roofs are one of the most cost effective choices due to their long lifespan: 50 to 100 years or more. According to TRI, clay tiles outlast many other roofing materials. In fact, in Asia and Europe, many structures with clay roof tiles have remained intact, functional and beautiful for centuries with limited maintenance.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When it comes to pricing for tile roofs vs. shingles, an asphalt shingle roof seems like the winner — but it depends on what a homeowner wants out of a roof. Roofers and their customers will pay less for material and installation per square on an asphalt project, but looking at long-term return on investment, the longevity of a tile roof makes it surprisingly frugal. By providing both systems, roofing contractors can offer a choice for both price-sensitive customers and those who want the long-term benefits of a more sustainable roof.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2>Tile Roof vs. Shingles: Installation Challenges</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Whichever type of roofing your clients choose, the rest of the structure will need to support its weight. Not every home's structure can handle tile, so you'll need to consider whether a tile roof will require special framing to support it. You'll also need to assess whether your crews have the skills to reframe a house or can partner with another contractor.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>A key part of successful tile roof installation is understanding how to install flashings and underlayment, which are a critical part of the roof's water resistance. While an asphalt shingle roof may only require <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everybodyneedsaroof.com/asphalt-shingles#underlay\">a single layer of No. 15 felt</a> (depending on the slope), a heavy tile roof may require multiple layers of No. 30 felt or a hybrid or synthetic underlayment. If a roofing contractor installs an inadequate underlayment, their customer runs the risk of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buildingadvisor.com/tile-roofing-underalyment/\">underlayment aging out before the tile itself</a>. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>As with any new system, training is critical. Training your crews on the overall system requirements of tile — including recommended substrates, underlayments and accessories — will allow you to offer another roofing option, and help homeowners determine the best choice for their home.</p> \n<p></p>",

To determine if solar makes sense for your home, you'll have to consider a few factors, including the local climate, the home's orientation, the roof's structural integrity, warranties, repairs and connecting to the grid.</p> \n<h2>North by Northwest: Climate and Orientation</h2> \n<p>Solar panels will only absorb as much energy as they're exposed to. That means warmer, sunnier climates are generally more suitable than colder regions. You can still install solar if you live in cold and cloudy Maine, but you may need to add extra panels than if you lived in Arizona.</p> \n<p>Another factor is the roof's orientation. In the Northern hemisphere, south-, southeast- and southwest-facing roofs will produce the most energy. Additionally, homeowners need to verify that obstacles like other buildings, trees or satellite dishes aren't casting significant shade on the roof.</p> \n<h2>Roof Structure and Materials</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://news.energysage.com/average-solar-panel-size-weight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solar rooftop panels weigh</a> an average of 40 pounds each, so the roof must be structurally prepared to handle the additional load. It's wise to hire a contractor to evaluate your roof, especially if your home is older.</p> \n<p>Homeowners should also consider that a solar rooftop might outlast the shingles underneath it. If you expect to renovate your roof within a shorter time period than is covered in the panels' warranty, the process of disconnecting and reinstalling the panels will be an added expense to budget for.</p> \n<h2>Connecting to the Grid</h2> \n<p>Once you know the roof can handle a solar installation, the next step is finding out how your new power source will connect to local utilities. To determine how your solar system will be hooked up to the local electric company, Texas-based <a href=\"https://freedomsolarpower.com/blog/10-questions-to-ask-before-you-consider-installing-solar-panels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freedom Solar Power</a> recommends homeowners ask the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How long with it take to get hooked up?</li> \n <li>Are there any hookup fees?</li> \n <li>Will I be credited for any generated electricity returned to the grid (net metering)?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Solar policies vary among utility companies, and some are more favorable to homeowners than others. Check with your local and state department of energy or power companies for net metering and interconnection standards.</p> \n<h2>Budgeting for Solar Installation and Use</h2> \n<p>Anyone considering solar panels should also research the available rebates and tax credits. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1235\">Federal Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit</a> permits homeowners to deduct 26% of the installation cost for a solar energy system from their federal taxes through 2020. Additionally, many states (and some utility companies) offer incentives, which can be reviewed on the <a href=\"https://www.dsireusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency</a>.</p> \n<p>Monthly electrical usage is also a consideration for solar installations — the higher your power bill, the more cost-effective the solar panels will be.</p> \n<h2>Warranties</h2> \n<p>While solar rooftop warranties usually cover equipment and product performance, this will vary among manufacturers. The different components — the inverter, racking, monitoring equipment and software — may be covered under separate warranties by other companies. Ask your roofing contractor for their recommendations on what to expect from solar panel performance and warranty coverage.</p> \n<p>Installing solar panels on your home's roof is a big decision. Take the time to research what is best for your home and budget and the potential benefits. </p>",

            "title": "What Forms Do I Need to Hire an Independent Contractor?",
            "body": "<p>Bringing on additional workers to boost your workforce can feel like navigating a minefield when tax time rolls around. If you're like most roofing pros, at some point you've asked yourself, \"What forms do I need to hire an independent contractor?\" Luckily, we've got your back with this primer.</p> \n<p>Essentially, there are two types of documents to be aware of: the official forms required by the IRS and the contracts needed to protect yourself and your business. </p> \n<h2 class=\"\">W-9 and 1096</h2> \n<p class=\"\">As far as the IRS is concerned, the only documents you need to hire an independent contractor are a W-9 and a 1096. The W-9 is completed by the worker, which includes their tax ID number and filing information. The 1096 is submitted to the IRS by January 31 and summarizes all your 1099 payments made the previous year. The IRS website <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/forms-and-associated-taxes-for-independent-contractors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provides a more complete rundown</a>.</p> \n<p>But while those are the only forms the IRS officially requires, there are others you should be looking for as well. The IRS is on the lookout for employers attempting to classify traditional employees as 1099 to avoid making payroll taxes. It's important that you protect yourself and your business by gathering documentation to prove that your contractors are truly independent.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">A Good Defense</h2> \n<p>Ask around, and you'll find no shortage of opinions about what exactly defines an \"independent contractor.\" But the only opinion that really counts is what the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-defined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS says about it</a>: \"The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done.\"</p> \n<p>You want to prove that you hired an independent contractor to do roof work (or supplementary HVAC, welding or drywall) to certain specifications, without instructing them how to deploy their workers or manage their resources. The two easiest ways to establish that proof are to draw up a contract for each assignment and to require an invoice from the contractor before cutting a check.</p> \n<p>This is more easily done on larger projects than on small one-off jobs, but contracts can be structured to cover individual jobs or even a series of small projects. A simple contract, along with the resulting invoice, makes a strong case that your contractor is operating independently and does not fall under the classification of a W-2 employee. It's well worth the effort.</p> \n<p class=\"\">One other way to make sure you're classifying your worker correctly is to ask the IRS. You can fill out a Form SS-8 to get an official ruling from the IRS on a worker's role. Not surprisingly, it isn't the quickest option — the IRS says it can take up to six months to get an answer. (For a more thorough walk-through of this process, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refer to the IRS' instructions</a>.)</p> \n<p class=\"\">While the answer to \"What forms do I need to hire an independent contractor?\" is officially just a W-9 to start and a 1096 at the end of the year, be sure to create a paper trail that you can refer back to if needed.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "How to work with a local org/school to set up an apprenticeship/coop program for students",
            "title": "How to Develop a Roofer Apprentice Program",
            "body": "<p>According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, roofing employment is expected to grow 13%, or over 1,000 jobs, by 2028. This is good news for the industry, but it also means that employers can expect to run into a labor crunch. To avoid that headache, consider proactively cultivating new prospects by working with local organizations or schools to start a roofer apprentice program.</p> \n<h2>What Is a Roofer Apprentice Program?</h2> \n<p>Roofing apprentice programs are a time-tested way to pass on knowledge to the next generation. An apprenticeship is traditionally a paid, full-time position where a new worker is trained on the ins and outs of the trade.</p> \n<p>Many modern programs tie an apprenticeship to course credit at a high school, college or vocational school. In these co-op classes, the student works in the field part time or full time for a set period, after which they return to the classroom. Some co-ops have recurring windows, so that a student worker may come on and off the workforce repeatedly, their skills growing each time.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of an Apprenticeship Program</h2> \n<p>In the case of a co-op, the student's pay might be supplemented by the educational institution, essentially giving the roofing company an employee at below-market cost. In addition, bringing young men and women into the fold not only supports the next generation of tradespeople, it also provides a defined employment track at your company.</p> \n<p>Even better, young roofers on their first job are trained from day one on your in-house procedures, preventing the need to unlearn bad habits from a previous employer. In fact, many co-op programs are tied to shop or machining classes, meaning you won't need to spend much time on basics like how to adjust a safety harness or use a nail gun.</p> \n<h2>Drawbacks: Setting up Training </h2> \n<p>To make the most of having an apprentice, you'll need experienced roofers capable of fulfilling their own duties while also supervising a green worker. If your current employees are standoffish or unwilling to train the apprentice, then you'll be wasting your money and a young person's time.</p> \n<p>Another common concern is the youthful nature of co-op workers. Maturity levels vary from student to student, and you can't know in advance how prepared your co-ops will be for the workforce. If this is a major hurdle, consider programs like <a href=\"https://helmetstohardhats.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helmets to Hardhats</a> that work with slightly older individuals transitioning from military service to the construction trades.</p> \n<h2>Getting Started</h2> \n<p>Roofing companies that decide they can handle young trainees often partner with a local school. If you can't find a school with an active roofer apprentice program, it may be worth your time to help set one up.</p> \n<p>Start by researching other local trades to find what schools or organizations they're partnered with. Those schools' administrations already have the legal and logistical framework in place to run a co-op, so you won't have to reinvent the wheel. Still, expect to jump through a number of hoops. You'll likely have to provide a list of skills that co-op workers will learn, and in the case of high schools, anticipate background checks for everyone who will be working with the student.</p> \n<p>Starting a co-op program from scratch can be a lot of work, but it can yield massive benefits in the long run. It's an excellent way to guide young people to consider the roofing trades, and it can give your company the inside track on capturing the best of the next generation of roofers.</p>",

            "title": "Preserve the Past During Historic Roof Construction",
            "body": "<p>One of the most reliable ways to improve a home's profile and curb appeal is to update its roof. This is true for homes built in 2020, 1920, 1820 or any year. For historic homes, an appropriate roof profile can make the difference between preserving historic character and creating an architectural hodgepodge. Whatever style of historic roof construction you're dealing with, the key considerations are the same.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Understand the Permit Process</h2> \n<p>When dealing with historic properties, the most important step is to understand what the requirements are, not only from the local building department but also with any historic district or homeowners association. Those last two groups can be problematic, because while permit issuance generally follows a rigid set of rules, other organizations are more apt to be swayed by what \"feels\" right. </p> \n<p>You can save yourself and your client numerous headaches by getting regular sign-offs from the necessary bodies as you develop the roofing plan. Remember that having a stamp of approval from a historical commission will often sway any questions in your favor should there be issues during the permit issuance.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Historic Expertise</h2> \n<p>If there is a neighborhood in your working territory with a specific historic style, learn the ins and outs of working with those materials. One unexpected resource for this kind of research is the National Park Service (NPS). Many historical buildings fall under the parks department's oversight, and there's a wealth of material on historic roof construction from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/4-roofing.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NPS</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/07231812.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Forest Service</a> and the<a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/RoofingTechGuide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> U.S. General Services Administration</a>.</p> \n<p>Another great resource is attending a session of the local historic society. While you're there, talk to commission members even if you don't have a job lined up. Showing genuine interest in the history of these homes and buildings can pay off in a big way down the line. Historic commission members are also great sources for leads on vintage materials, or for other roofing pros who can share tips for working on specific styles or eras of historic homes. Show people that you're an expert on a specific historical period, and rather than having to advertise, you'll find customers are coming to you.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Replacement Products</h2> \n<p>While some historical areas require exact material matches, others are more lenient, or may even require modernized versions of historic elements, such as <a href=\"https://www.becn.com/productDetail/C-291152%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">synthetic slate</a>. Keep up to date on the pros and cons of these materials, and offer potential clients a range of options. Replica materials are also more likely to be compatible with modern installation tools and techniques, so you won't have to give up your nail gun for a mallet!</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Warehousing</h2> \n<p>Once you focus on a specific historical style and start getting hired for projects, you'll find that authentic period materials are worth their weight in gold. Keep an eye out for demolition work or sales on websites such as Craigslist or eBay to snatch up materials like slate, fieldstone and more. You may need to set aside space in your shop or rent a separate storage space, but depending on your market and the materials you store, the savings may easily make up for it.</p> \n<p>Whatever time period you decide to focus on, remember that you're doing something important. Preserving the history of local homes, shops and religious buildings is essential work. Be proud of your finished product, and know that you're preserving a piece of history for future generations.</p>",

            "title": "What Is EPDM Roofing?",
            "body": "<p>As a commercial contractor, you know that not all roofing materials are created equal. Knowing what material to recommend to a client — and being able to explain why you're recommending it — can help your business stand out from the competition.</p> \n<p>One type of roofing material that contractors often use is ethylene propylene diene terpolymer, commonly known as EPDM. But what is EPDM roofing? Learn more about this popular material, why you might install it and what types of roofs it is best suited for.</p> \n<h2>What Is EPDM Roofing?</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://epdmroofs.org/what-is-epdm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EPDM Roofing Association</a> (ERA) describes EPDM as a durable, synthetic rubber roofing membrane. The primary ingredients in EPDM are ethylene and propylene, both of which come from natural gas and oil. Since <a href=\"http://www.everybodyneedsaroof.com/thermoset-membranes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EPDM is thermoset</a>, it doesn't become soft and pliable when heated.</p> \n<p>Usually, EPDM roofing comes in sheets that can measure anywhere from 7.5 feet wide to 50 feet wide. The sheets are usually between 45 and 60 mils (1 mil is equal to 0.001 inch, according to the <a href=\"http://www.everybodyneedsaroof.com/single-ply-membranes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NRCA</a>), although the <a href=\"https://epdmroofs.org/what-is-epdm/historical-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ERA</a> notes that a 90-mil thick EPDM roofing material has recently been introduced. The thicker the material, the better it can withstand rain and wind damage.</p> \n<p>The most common color for EPDM roofing sheets is black, but white, reflective sheeting is also available. Which color a contractor chooses should depend on the number of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.weather.gov/key/climate_heat_cool\">cooling degree days and heating degree days</a> in the region. In the Northern states, where there are more cooling days than heating days, black EPDM roofing conserves energy by allowing the snow and ice to melt more quickly from the roof system. In the Southern states, where there are more heating days than cooling days, a white PVC or TPO membrane is a better choice to reflect the sun's heat and conserve energy.</p> \n<h2>The Benefits of EPDM</h2> \n<p>Why is EPDM one of the most popular materials among roofing contractors? This material is fairly hardy in the face of roof damage. EPDM can withstand hail, fluctuations in temperature and ultraviolet exposure. It can also put up with prolonged exposure to ozone and abrasion. One key benefit of EPDM for roofers is that large rolls and pre-fab options make it relatively easy to install on low-slope roofs. </p> \n<p>There are also some environmental benefits of installing an EPDM roof. The <a href=\"https://epdmroofs.org/faq-type/general-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ERA</a> mentions that EPDM roofing has a \"low embodied energy number,\" which means that the amount of energy needed to produce the material and create the roofing sheets is very low. Once EPDM has reached the end of its usable life on a roof, it can easily be recycled and kept out of the landfill.</p> \n<h2>How Does EPDM Compare to Other Materials?</h2> \n<p>EPDM is often compared to two other common membranes that can be used on low-slope commercial roofs: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and thermoplastic olefin (TPO). All three are around the same price point, according to<a href=\"https://www.roofingcalc.com/epdm-rubber-roofing-cost-vs-pvc-and-tpo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Roofing Calculator</a>, but differ in installation and resistance to factors like weathering and heat.</p> \n<p>Unlike EPDM, both PVC and TPO are thermoplastic, meaning they can be installed with a heat welder. Meanwhile, EPDM seams are sealed with seam tape. Roofing Calculator notes that EPDM sometimes fails in overall durability compared with other membranes, especially if it is installed by a contractor who is inexperienced with the material. No matter which membrane options you offer to your roofing clients, make sure your crews know how to safely and correctly install the membrane itself and accessories such as ventilation.</p> \n<p>EPDM's availability in wide rolls makes it suitable for very large, flat roofs on buildings such as warehouses, shopping centers or hotels. </p> \n<p>Why learn about EPDM? Knowing the tools and materials of the roofing trade will help you offer clients the best roofing options and the best service possible.</p>",

            "body": "<p>While it's easy to appreciate the beauty of the first snowflakes settling on your rooftop, as the snow builds up, you might begin to wonder when to shovel your roof. Should you shovel up there at all? </p> \n<p>The answer is generally no: clambering around a slippery roof in the winter without protective equipment can lead to a serious and potentially fatal fall. Instead, before the snow hits this winter, learn the signs that should lead you to find a roofing pro to remove snow from your roof. </p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Roof Pitch and Snow Load</h2> \n<p>Some snow on the roof is actually a good thing. It adds insulation and <a href=\"https://energysvc.com/what-snow-on-the-roof-can-tell-you-about-a-homes-insulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slightly reduces</a> your heating bill. However, rooftop snowdrifts that are too big can lead to ice dam buildup and even roof collapse.</p> \n<p>There are a few variables that determine how much snow your roof can handle, one of which is the slope of your roof. A low slope roof disperses the weight of snow differently than a steep slope roof does, and is more likely to collapse under a snowdrift, explains the Minneapolis-based contractor <a href=\"https://www.icedamremovalguys.com/when-should-i-remove-snow-from-my-roof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ice Dam Guys</a>. Snow also tends to slide off a steeper roof, so there is not as much accumulation.</p> \n<p>Next, consider whether the snow is light and powdery or wet and heavy. Wet, heavy snow should be cleared once it reaches a foot deep, even with a pitched roof.</p> \n<p>To get a sense of how much weight the snow is placing on your roof, <a href=\"https://www.idahofarmbureauinsurance.com/tools-resources/protecting-your-world/prevent-a-roof-collapse-remove-snow-and-ice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farm Bureau Insurance</a> recommends a quick calculation: Multiply the number of inches of snow depth by 1.25 lbs to find the weight in pounds per square foot. For solid ice, multiply the number of inches by 5.2 lbs. A combination would be (S x 1.25lbs) + (I x 5.2lbs) = P, where \"S\" represents the inches of snow (depth) on the roof, \"I\" represents the inches (depth) of ice buildup on the roof and \"P\" is the pounds per square foot.</p> \n<p>An easier way to estimate this, without writing any math problems, is to cut a 1-foot by 1-foot cube of the snow from its deepest point on your roof. (Only gather snow if you can safely reach it from a window or lower structure such as a porch.) Put the snow cube into a plastic bag and weigh it, advises Colorado-based <a href=\"https://berletroofing.com/when-should-i-shovel-my-roof-to-remove-snow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Berlet Roofing</a>. Generally speaking, once the snow load reaches 40 lbs per square foot, it's time to shovel your roof.</p> \n<p>Another useful test is checking if all the windows and doors in the house open and close easily. If even one is sticking, it could indicate the snow is putting too much weight on the roof and warping the door and window frames.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">How to Remove the Snow</h2> \n<p>It's best to call in a professional to clear off the roof. A snow-free home is not worth accidentally damaging the shingles or structure or injuring yourself.</p> \n<p>If you're concerned for your home's safety, however, it is possible to use a roof rake to remove snow with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Start with the overhangs, and then get up into the valleys as much as possible. Avoid tossing salt or other snowmelt chemicals onto your roof. These products can be corrosive and may not be formulated for roofing materials, so it's best to avoid them.</p> \n<p>If you're wondering when to shovel your roof, stop and think if your shovel is really the right tool for the job. It's usually best to bring in the snow removal professionals.</p>",

            "title": "Conducting an Effective Roofing Worksite Safety Training",
            "body": "<p>Conducting a roofing worksite safety training program is one of the best ways to protect your roofers from the hazards of the trade, from a fall off a slippery ladder to a careless nail gun accident. A worksite safety training program educates your employees, establishes protocols, recognizes good safety practices and identifies potential jobsite hazards that could endanger your contractors.</p> \n<p>As you develop your safety program, a few strategies will help you conduct a training that sticks and encourages your workers to apply what they learn.</p> \n<h2>Don't Forget OSHA Regulations</h2> \n<p>It's mandatory that you cover all relevant <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/doc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OSHA regulations</a> during worksite safety training. While this may sound boring, specific guidance to the construction industry can reduce the number of accidents, injuries and near-misses that occur. Roofing is a high-hazard industry, and all of the fine print about guardrail post distances and ladder loads exists to keep your workers safe.</p> \n<p>Make sure your roofers view regulations with a serious eye rather than an eye roll. OSHA guidelines can provide you with a useful <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blueprint for your worksite safety training program</a>, ensuring you cover topics such as the safe handling of flammable materials, ladder safety, proper fall protection and emergency action plans.</p> \n<h2>Make Your Training Relevant and Applicable</h2> \n<p>The ideal place to conduct a training is at a jobsite, using the actual equipment and making it a hands-on experience. That way, your workers learn in as realistic an environment as possible, and have an opportunity to demonstrate what they've learned. </p> \n<p>Hands-on practice means they can apply what they learned immediately rather than waiting for the next job. Using the actual equipment also encourages discussion, which can entice veterans on the crew to share real-life examples to complement the lesson.</p> \n<h2>Use Trainers Who Know How to Effectively Communicate</h2> \n<p>If you don't conduct a safety training yourself, you should look for an instructor who can use a conversational tone and speak with the same language your workers use and understand. A trainer should avoid using a lecturing or monotone voice, and back up their talk track with useful visuals such as pictures of safety signs, tags and labels workers will see at the jobsite. If you want to cover a specific area, like recognizing fall hazards, you may want to hire an outside trainer who is qualified to train on that particular topic.</p> \n<p>You may find a series of short and frequent training sessions is more productive than one all-day session. Ask around for trainers who can deliver regulations and techniques in quick hits, such as a 15-minute toolbox talk at the beginning of a workday.</p> \n<p>Whether long or short, training talks should actively involve workers through Q&amp;A sessions, opportunities to share their experiences, demonstrations and hands-on learning. </p> \n<h2>Follow Up With Inspections</h2> \n<p class=\"\">A good way to start a safe workday at the jobsite is to ask each worker to inspect their work area, tools and personal protective equipment (PPE). Is it in good repair? Have hand and power tools been properly cleaned and maintained? Have weather conditions caused any safety hazards since the last workday? You can have your roofing team do a walkaround, either in small groups or as a whole crew, to inspect the area for any potential hazards.<br></p> \n<p>The most effective safety training is one that your workers will remember and learn from. Worksite safety training provides roofers the skills needed to avoid unsafe working practices. Even a short session can ramp up their understanding of workplace hazards and teach them how to identify, control and reduce them.</p>",

            "title": "Determining the Cost to Replace a Roof",
            "body": "<p>The cost to replace a roof can vary widely, and depends on a number of different factors. That's why it's important for homeowners contemplating a roof replacement to do some preliminary research and get several estimates before embarking on this big project.</p> \n<p>Learn what goes into the cost of a roof replacement and how you can calculate what your new roof's price tag might be.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Estimates Begin With Price per Square Foot</h2> \n<p class=\"\">A variety of factors go into a roof replacement estimate, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.roofingcalc.com/roof-replacement-cost/\">Roofing Calculator</a>. Generally speaking, the range most contractors go by is between $3.50 and $5.50 per square foot to install architectural shingles (also known as \"dimensional\" shingles). A square equals 100 square feet of roof surface.</p> \n<p>Even for a standard asphalt roof, the price of your roof replacement will depend on the individual brand and type of shingles you select.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/roofing/asphalt-shingles-install-replace/\"> HomeAdvisor</a>'s 2020 guide reports that the average asphalt shingle roof replacement costs around $7,297, but that more modest and more high-end options can push the full range to $2,000 to $14,000. The cost of a new roof also varies according to the region you live in.</p> \n<h2>What Is an Estimate Based On?</h2> \n<p>Replacing a roof is a complicated process, so contractors' estimates must cover a variety of factors. One key component is the cost of materials. Slate or high-end tile will cost more than shingles, for example, and you may need to pay for replacement components such as flashing or gutters. Your roofing contractor will also estimate the cost of labor, including the time and effort to tear off the old roof. Finally, they will need to account for the recycling or trashing of old roofing materials and any disposal charges.</p> \n<ul></ul> \n<p>A roof that is difficult to access can also earn you a markup. If contractors require special equipment to climb up safely or haul up materials, the extra work may translate to added costs for equipment and labor.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Budgeting for Your New Roof</h2> \n<p>To reduce the cost of a roof replacement without cutting corners, you should get estimates from several roofing contractors (and check their references while you're at it). Avoid scheduling roof replacement during the late summer or early fall months, when roofers are typically the busiest. Scheduling a late-winter or spring replacement time may come with an off-season reduction in price.</p> \n<p>You should also keep in mind that the most cost-effective replacement materials to use may be different than the materials that currently make up your roof. Switching from tile to asphalt or slate to metal may help keep costs down. Finally, ask your contractor about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.becn.com/homeowner-financing\">the homeowner financing options</a> they offer.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Consider Carefully</h2> \n<p>Be cautious about accepting a roofing contractor's bid if it's far below what other professionals are bidding. These low-end bids may come from roofers who \"are either desperate for work or...happen to work on volume with razor-thin margins,\" according to <a href=\"https://www.roofingcalc.com/roof-replacement-cost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roofing Calculator</a>. Ask around for referrals or look at companies with <a href=\"https://www.beaconroofingsupply.com/Beacon_Roofing_Supply_Industry_Affiliations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strong industry affiliations</a> that support contractors, architects and builders who are experts in their fields.</p> \n<p>An expert can help you determine if it's possible to repair your existing roof instead of replacing it. A roof in overall good condition with a few specific problem areas might warrant repair, not replacement, as long as the repairs aren't a temporary band-aid for a roof that will soon need to be overhauled.</p> \n<p>The more you learn about the factors involved in the cost to replace a roof, the better prepared you will be to consider a roofing contractor's estimate.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Every new hire represents an important investment in a roofing company's future, regardless of their position. In order to thrive, these new employees require the best possible roofing training and development.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, some companies either don't address training or make the process too complicated. Ideally, orientation and roofing training and development programs should impart the company's culture while setting attainable goals for the new employee.</p> \n<h2>Setting up a Training: The Basics</h2> \n<p>Because most roofing hires do not come in batches, a one-on-one orientation meeting is a common training model. This discussion should center on company culture and mission statement, safety policies and signing preliminary forms or agreements. If your company has an employee handbook, you can highlight a few important areas.</p> \n<p>After orientation, in-house training in a classroom setting can be a great way to create a dedicated learning environment and improve employee communications. Keep training time to no more than four hours and avoid weekends.</p> \n<p>For craft training, keep the classroom trade-specific and work on repetitive skills like flashing a chimney, laying out a roof plan or reviewing the five most common reasons for roof leaks.</p> \n<h2>10 Quick Tips for Classroom Training</h2> \n<p>Here are some tips for improving training skills in a classroom setting:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>The trainer's opening remarks should center on the short- and long-term benefits of the training program for the employee.</li> \n <li>A trainer's attitude should always be positive and enthusiastic when answering questions — never critical or sarcastic.</li> \n <li>Follow a pre-class checklist, and ensure all working demonstrations are performing reliably.</li> \n <li>Give out training materials one piece at a time as each subject is addressed. This will help students stay focused on the presentation and not move ahead.</li> \n <li>Keep participants engaged with models, training videos and hands-on work when practical.</li> \n <li>Videos and other media should be short. Aim to go no longer than 10 minutes without interacting with trainees.</li> \n <li>Encourage everyone to contribute to a discussion with a topic prompt like an industry innovation or installation technique.</li> \n <li>Use group or problem-solving exercises to take the focus off the trainer and onto the students.</li> \n <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rapidstartleadership.com/how-to-teach-using-the-edge-method-2-minute-tip/\">Consider the EDGE model</a> (Explain, Demonstrate, Guide and Enable) to encourage trainer-trainee interaction.</li> \n <li>Use video feedback to gauge the trainer's course design and content delivery skills.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Field Training</h2> \n<p>Designing a custom roofing training program for employees can be as simple as sharing what will be expected of them in the next 30 days based on their previous knowledge and the positions they were hired for. A trainer might decide to start a new hire on repetitive tasks like nailing shingles, or assign them to focus on a single task until they perfect it. Supervisors can also select another employee to help demonstrate a new procedure, or offer a demo themselves.</p> \n<p>Crew leads play a key role in the training and development process when it comes time to step onto the jobsite. Crew leads are responsible for helping alleviate the stress of taking on a new hire and looking for steady improvement in the quality of a new employee's work.</p> \n<p>In turn, management needs to discuss the employee's goals for the next month and check the new hire's progress with the crew lead at least once a week. At the end of 30 days, the team can work out the next time period and set of skills. Some companies tie pay scale to skill level to increase motivation and progress.</p> \n<h2>Industry Training</h2> \n<p>Roofing manufacturers and distributors have invested in training programs to address the labor shortage and ensure their products are installed correctly. The local sales representative is typically the contractor's key contact when assessing training opportunities.</p> \n<p>All of these training strategies will require contractors to commit time, money or both. Matching the right personnel to the subject matter is also critical — don't send a crew lead to a seminar if the ideal student is a salesperson. It's also a good idea for managers to attend classes with employees and remind the instructor of any concerns.</p> \n<p>Groups like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nrca.net/education\">National Roofing Contractors Association</a> offer a plethora of training opportunities that allow learning at every level of a roofing company.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Do you have what it takes to become a roofer? Whether you're just starting out or are considering changing careers, the industry is full of opportunities. In fact, the employment of roofers is expected to increase by 12% by 2028, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/roofers.htm#tab-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS). Learn more about the skills and training that roofers need and the salary you can expect once you find your first roofing job.</p> \n<h2>Which Skills Do Roofers Need?</h2> \n<p>Roofing is a very physical job, so it's important that people who become roofers have strength and stamina. As a roofer, you'll have to carry heavy tools and bundles of shingles. You'll also spend a lot of time on your feet and might have to bend and lift throughout the day. Since roofers typically work in all types of weather, you might spend days working under the hot sun and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.becn.com/beacon-talks/5-tips-for-finding-and-hiring-seasonal-employees\">in the rain or cold</a>.</p> \n<p>It's also important to have dexterity as a roofer, as you'll need to install shingles and other roofing materials precisely. If you're interested in working with certain types of materials, such as slate, you might need more training compared to a roofer who works exclusively with asphalt shingles or built-up roofing.</p> \n<p>Along with physical strength and endurance, other skills you'll need as a roofer include good communication skills, customer service skills and a good sense of balance. Since you will be working on high surfaces, it helps to not have a fear of heights!</p> \n<h2>What Sorts of Training Do You Need to Become a Roofer?</h2> \n<p>Often, beginning roofers learn on the job or through an apprenticeship. Apprenticeship programs are often sponsored by contractor associations or unions, and typically last for three to five years, the <a href=\"https://www.unionroofers.com/Training-and-Education/Apprenticeship.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers</a> notes. During an apprenticeship, you complete on-the-job training and classroom work at an apprentice center or a trade school. Unlike internships, which tend to be unpaid, apprenticeships pay you for the time you spend working. In addition to an hourly wage, many roofing apprentices also <a href=\"https://www.becn.com/beacon-talks/boost-recruitment-and-retention-with-strong-employee-benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earn benefits</a> such as health care coverage and a pension plan.</p> \n<p>If you're interested in becoming an apprentice, ask local trade schools or trade organizations like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nrca.net/education/trac\">National Roofing Contractors Association</a> to learn more about the application process. The specific application and program requirements will vary from sponsor to sponsor. Most likely, your experience, physical abilities and previous education will all play a part in determining whether you get accepted to an apprenticeship program or not.</p> \n<h2>How Much Will You Earn as a Roofer?</h2> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/roofers.htm#tab-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BLS</a>, the median annual salary for a roofer was $39,970 as of May 2018. As an apprentice, you're more likely to be paid by the hour. The availability of work in your area can affect your earnings. For example, you might find that you work and earn more in the spring and summer compared to in the winter when jobs are few and far between.</p> \n<p>If you're interested in beginning a career in roofing, it's a good idea to contact a roofing contractor in your area. Ask if you can speak with them about their experience and about the steps involved to get started on your new career.</p>",

            "title": "What Are the Right Questions to Ask for a Testimonial?",
            "body": "<p>What are your customers saying about you? It's one question every roofing contractor should be asking themselves. An excellent way to stay in front of what your customers are saying — and be sure that future customers hear the good reviews — is to gather testimonials.</p> \n<p>But what are the right questions to ask for a testimonial? Any prospective client wants to work with a company that has a good reputation and has completed exemplary work on buildings or homes like their own. They want to know that their roofing contractor excels in all types of roofing they may be considering, and confirm it through quotes from other customers.</p> \n<p>But many roofing contractors are shy about asking for reviews or feel that it's not professional. Soliciting reviews is perfectly professional if you go about it the right way. In fact, if your sales team is completing their sales cycle correctly, it should be very easy to get feedback on every job.</p> \n<p>More important than knowing the right questions to ask for a testimonial is knowing how and when to ask them. Here are five key pieces of advice to keep in mind.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Ask Immediately</h2> \n<p>One of the most important parts of a roofing installation is the final inspection, which is also the perfect time to ask how your company performed and how your client feels about the overall result. The longer the salesperson or head contractor waits to confirm satisfaction with the client, the more danger there is of losing the new-roof glow.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Record and Write It Down</h2> \n<p>Ask customers if you can make a recording of their testimonial and take pictures of them in front of the completed roof. Audio or video can be transcribed, and quotes easily pulled from the text. If a client doesn't want to be recorded, write down what they say instead.</p> \n<p>Be prepared with the selling points you want to make to future customers and include them in your questions. By writing or recording what they say during the final inspection and sending a transcription back to the customer for approval, you have the chance to guide the discussion and make it easy for them to provide quotes.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Consider the Beginning, Middle and End</h2> \n<p>Ask your clients questions that run the life of the sale, including how they discovered and chose your business, whether they felt they had all the information to make an informed decision about the estimation and what they think of the final roof.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid to ask how your roofing company can improve for the future. Besides recording positive feedback for testimonials, salespeople and business owners need to be ready to deal with negative feedback. Correct any errors, then ask the customer about the changes you've made. Encouraging complete honesty leads to stronger testimonials and more opportunity for overall improvement.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Compliment Your Client</h2> \n<p>If the homeowner or facility manager is not at the final inspection (you should ask them to attend), call them immediately and ask for their feedback. Lead with a compliment of how much you respect and value their review of the job, and proceed with the interview.</p> \n<p>After reviewing the job and getting feedback and testimonials, don't forget to ask about your client's future work and roofing needs. The best time to ask is when they're happy with their new roof. Not only can they provide a testimonial, they can also keep you in mind for a friend, neighbor or their next project.</p>",

            "title": "The Clear Glass Roof Trend: Is It Right for Your Client?",
            "body": "<p>From the classic clear glass roof of a greenhouse to modern sunrooms and commercial buildings, translucent roofs give natural sunlight and warmth to interior spaces. Today, there's an array of options in the translucent roofing market, and understanding them can pay off in a big way when you're able to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.becn.com/beacon-talks/how-to-provide-excellent-customer-service-as-a-roofing-contractor\">help clients</a> make the best choice.</p> \n<h2>Translucent Roofing Material Options</h2> \n<p>Polycarbonate sheets, glass and ETFE currently make up the bulk of translucent roofing materials, and each has a variety of pros and cons.</p> \n<p>A clear glass roof, for example, will tend to increase heating and cooling bills, so it should be laminated or tempered (depending on code requirements). Installation techniques vary by application, but typically involve a glazing grid of aluminum. The translucent material is then laid in from above and sealed in place. Slope and structure must conform to the manufacturer's specs, and all precautions should be taken to ensure that any potential failure will be away from interior spaces.</p> \n<p>Available in a range of grades, flat or corrugated polycarbonate sheets are popular for patios, awnings, backyard swimming pools and sheds. They can be installed using typical DIY tools, making them a popular choice for homeowners. Professional crews are more likely to install polycarbonate sheets in applications for barns or warehouses, which demand a more expert approach.</p> \n<p>In 2010, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/12/12/metrodome-collapse-monday\">Minnesota Vikings' stadium roof collapsed</a> under the weight of accumulated snow. Their replacement was a roof composed of translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) film. With a steep slope and added reflectivity to direct snowmelt into a runoff system, Vikings fans now comfortably watch games under natural light. </p> \n<p>ETFE is becoming a go-to choice for large or complex translucent roofs. It's robust, allows plenty of light infiltration and weighs about 1% of a similarly sized glass roof. It can be installed in a single layer or \"sandwiched\" to allow pressurized air pockets to add insulation and light control. Even better, that pressurization can be controlled electronically to allow for changes in the environment. Unfortunately, those technical bells and whistles come with a reliance on additional tech, and the thinner nature of ETFE means that it transmits sound easier, making it inappropriate for small, noisy areas.</p> \n<p>Because of the specialized nature of these installations, educational training is available for contractors through manufacturers or organizations like <a href=\"https://www.theagi.org/glass-worker-education.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Architectural Glass Institute</a>.</p> \n<h2>The Right Roof for the Right Client</h2> \n<p>Translucent roofing is a good choice for customers who want to highlight an open space or showcase their decision to install translucent roofing. It's about style as much as lighting. If the client simply wants additional light, consider steering them toward a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.becn.com/beacon-talks/what-residential-contractors-need-to-know-about-installing-skylights\">conventional skylight</a> or solar tube.</p> \n<p class=\"\">It's equally important to know which environments aren't suited for translucent roofing. Without the traditional substructure of eaves and sheathing, translucent roofs must be robust enough to deal with not only their own weight, but also extra loads such as snow. Remember that if the roof will be accessible, then the material must also function as a translucent <em></em>floor. In addition, areas with severe weather such as hurricanes or hail won't be good matches. (Even with manufacturer warranties against hail damage, there's no reason to sign up for the aggravation of regularly filing claims.)</p> \n<p>That said, anything is possible with sufficient engineering. If your client has the funding and you've got the expertise, you can give them the roof they want.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "Know how to hire the right accountant for your roofing business",
            "title": "Should Your Roofing Business Hire an Accountant?",
            "body": "<p>Is it time for your roofing business to hire an accountant? How you choose to add this important function to your business will depend on your needs. Here are three options to consider for keeping the books.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Do-It-Yourself Accounting</h2> \n<p>The first option, which most people consider and many try, is to do it yourself. This may work for a limited time when you start your roofing business, but it's unlikely you can continue tracking all the finances as your company grows.</p> \n<p>While it's easy to download and set up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-free-accounting-software\">free or subscription-based accounting software</a>, you should understand the information being generated. If you don't have an accounting skill set or background, you may not know what the data is telling you.</p> \n<p>It could feel like you're saving money by not paying for an additional employee, but the time you're spending managing finances is time spent away from the jobsite. Accounting also comes with its own compliance hurdles. Are you taking care of all the right steps, like payroll taxes, income taxes and property taxes, or are you missing something?</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Hiring an Accountant for Your Roofing Business</h2> \n<p>Another option is to hire an accountant to join your team on either a full-time or part-time basis. Just like any job interviewee, ask about a potential hire's experience: Is the person self-taught, or do they have an accounting degree or CPA certification? Do they have a proven track record at other businesses? Are they mainly a bookkeeper, or do they have expertise in budgeting and financial planning?</p> \n<p>If you hire a full-time accountant, they will get to know your roofing business and won't be distracted by other businesses' accounting needs. You set the tasks they perform, which helps build a relationship that guarantees your sensitive financial information will remain confidential.</p> \n<p>Depending on where you're located, your business may be cyclical. Will you be tempted to pull your accountant into handling other business needs such as human resources? This may save money and keep your employee busy, but piling on unrelated work can also cause stress and time management challenges.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Outsourcing Your Accounting Needs</h2> \n<p>Cost is always a factor. When you outsource, you can opt to pay for only part-time or temporary help, and are not obligated to offer benefits. Hiring internally means you pay salary plus <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/understanding-overhead-expenses/\">overhead expenses</a>, which are frequently quoted as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://beebole.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-real-cost-of-an-employee/\">additional 25% to 40% of the cost</a> of an employee's salary.</p> \n<p>When searching for an outsourcing agent, you want a trustworthy, competent and reliable worker who understands your contracting business and offers more than just entering numbers in a ledger. Outsourcing means you will have experts in the field who undergo training as needed to keep up with technology and industry changes. But be aware that benefits and continuing education for an in-house CPA or other expert will be on your dime, not the outsourcing agent's.</p> \n<p>Typically, outsourcing accounting means you'll be serviced by a team, so there's no need to worry about getting financial data in a crunch if one specialized staff member is out sick or on vacation. It also provides an extra layer of checks and balances. Having one person solely handling cash, payments and budgets increases the potential for mistakes or fraud.</p> \n<h2>Is It Time to Hire an Accountant?</h2> \n<p>Accounting and financial record-keeping can be time-consuming and confusing, especially if you don't have accounting experience. Your roofing company's finances are a top priority. You have to understand the financial picture and have confidence in who is providing that information, so it's up to you to pick the option that works best for your business.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "Homeowners will learn the basic specs and uses of steel studs.",
            "title": "Metal Studs vs. Wood Studs: Why Steel Is Better",
            "body": "<p>For contractors and DIY homeowners, the metal studs vs. wood studs debate rages on. But if you look closely at the pros and cons of each material for use in drywall renovation or adding a wall to a home, some answers may emerge.</p> \n<p>Here's a quick look at the advantages and disadvantages of both materials, and our pick for a clear winner.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Wood Studs</h2> \n<p>Wood studs remain popular for drywall renovation or new construction for several reasons. This type of stud can sustain a considerable amount of weight in frames or load-bearing walls. Many still consider wood to be a dependable, long-lasting product, involving less work than metal and fewer specialized tools to cut and shape it.</p> \n<p>However, roofing contractors and homeowners doing the work themselves have noticed some significant shortcomings with wood studs, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"\">Wood's potential for damage from excess water or humidity.</li> \n <li class=\"\">The growing costs of hardwood materials.</li> \n <li class=\"\">Susceptibility to damage from termites and carpenter ants.</li> \n <li class=\"\">The higher risk of fire.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of these factors must be taken into consideration when determining your choice of metal studs vs. wood studs.</p> \n<h2>Advantages of Steel Studs</h2> \n<p>While metal studs may cost more than their wooden counterparts, this is offset by the enhanced durability of the product. As <a href=\"https://bethepro.com/benefits-metal-studs-six-reasons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BeThePro</a> notes,\"Warranty callbacks are minimized because steel does not shrink, split or warp.\" That means fewer calls to your roofing and drywall contractor about popped nails or cracks.</p> \n<p>Steel lasts much longer than wood (as long as rust doesn't set in), and metal studs are virtually impervious to fire. One advantage to metal studs is the reduced amount of waste material compared to wood. It may cost less to haul and dispose of unwanted materials if you have less scrap material to begin with.</p> \n<p>For contractors, the installation process is typically easier with metal studs. A skilled builder only needs a basic rivet gun, electrical shears and a drill to install steel studs, notes <a href=\"https://homeguides.sfgate.com/metal-studs-vs-wood-studs-framing-houses-79811.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SF Gate Home Guides</a>. Conversely, the use of wood studs might require an array of circular, table and chop saws and a framing nailer. Generally speaking, metal studs are also lighter than wood studs, making them easier to store and transport.</p> \n<h2>Benefits for Homeowners</h2> \n<p>In many cases, steel studs are generated from recycled materials — a plus for eco-conscious contractors and homeowners. And, as SF Gate Home Guides adds, wooden studs may need chemical treatment to safeguard them from rot or insect damage.</p> \n<p>It's also known that metal studs are earthquake resistant, an appealing factor for home construction and renovation in areas of significant seismic activity.</p> \n<p>Of course, neither option is entirely without disadvantages. Steel studs are sometimes more challenging to cut and shape than wood. Also, not every contractor has experience in the use of steel studs, since wood studs have a long tradition in the construction industry.</p> \n<p>Before embarking upon a drywall renovation or adding a wall to your home, learn more about the advantages steel studs bring to the project. It's also a good opportunity to assess whether or not your particular DIY skills are up to the challenge of installing steel studs, or if <a href=\"https://www.becn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finding the right contractor</a> is your best bet.</p>",

            "title": "Advantages of Buying Used Roofing Equipment",
            "body": "<p>Tools and equipment are major expenses for everyone in the roofing industry. It's no surprise that many pros are constantly on the lookout for quality used tools.</p> \n<p>The most obvious benefit of buying used roofing equipment is the price savings. Like cars, tools see a steep drop-off in price after they're used for the first time. The downside of buying used equipment is that the quality and reliability can be unpredictable. Jobsites are rough environments, and any used tool has gone through some degree of wear and tear that can result in a shortened life span or reduced functionality.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Buying Recent Models From Fellow Contractors</h2> \n<p>Ideally, you'll buy used roofing equipment from someone you know and trust, like an experienced roofing contractor who is further along in the trade. Pros who have recently upgraded their equipment are a great source for used goods. A major benefit from buying this way is that you'll know exactly what you're getting into. All used equipment has the potential for quirks or issues, so you're better off asking the current owner before opening your wallet.</p> \n<p>Be on the lookout for recent models, as they are usually compatible with current accessories but still offered at a reduced price. Watch out for major changes, such as the recent switch from 18-volt to 20-volt batteries on many cordless tool brands. You don't want to get stuck with equipment that's hard to integrate into your existing kit.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Former Rentals and Pawn Shops: Use Your Best Judgement</h2> \n<p>Another option is buying from a rental center. The downside is that an item has been used by dozens (if not hundreds) of people in its life span, and it's likely that some of them didn't know how to use that tool properly.</p> \n<p>The plus side is that after each return, the tool should have been inspected by rental workers to make sure it was in good shape. Regular inspection means that good rental equipment has been maintained better than most tools on a jobsite. If you have a good relationship with the staff at your local rental shop, let them know you're in the market, and they can steer you toward the best deals.</p> \n<p>Pawn shops are an option to be viewed with caution. Most pawn shops don't warranty their sales or accept returns, so if that new pneumatic nailer jams every third trigger pull, then you may be out of luck. Tools and construction equipment are prime targets for thieves, largely because they're relatively easy to resell. It's important to note that not all pawn shops traffic in stolen goods, but it's worth considering that when you buy from a person or business that doesn't feel reputable, you may be helping perpetuate the theft/resale cycle.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">When Only New Will Do</h2> \n<p>Safety equipment should always be purchased new. Even if it looks like it's in great shape, you don't know what stresses and strains that equipment has endured. Even the best savings in the world aren't worth risking your life or the safety of your crew members.</p> \n<p>When you're considering buying an expensive used tool, check out the manufacturer's warranty coverage. Some warranties last the life of the tool, while others are tied to a single owner and expire immediately upon resale. It's best to assume that any used tool will not be warrantied, so do your research. You just might find that some manufacturers back up their equipment more than you'd expect.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "Know why to choose steel roofing over aluminum roofing materials (or vice versa)",
            "title": "Aluminum Roofing vs. Steel Roofing",
            "body": "<p>Eco-friendly, durable and long-lasting, a metal roof is a great option for many residential roofing customers. But, after you and a homeowner have settled on a metal roof or re-roof, you still have to decide between a range of materials like copper, aluminum, zinc or steel. Aluminum and steel roofs are by far the most popular and practical options for most residential roofing projects. A few key distinctions between aluminum and steel roofing can make one more suitable than the other in different applications.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Properties of Aluminum and Steel Roofing</h2> \n<p>Aluminum stores very little heat and cools quickly once sunlight fades, making it a good choice for homeowners who want a material with cool-roof properties. Meanwhile, steel roofing is denser than aluminum, making it stronger and more fire-resistant even without underlayment. While aluminum can carry a Class A fire rating, this can only be achieved with proper underlayment and sheathing, according to the Perth Amboy, N.J.-based metal roofing contractor <a href=\"https://www.englertinc.com/blog/steel-and-aluminum-two-great-metal-roofing-materials-each-have-their-strengths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Englert</a>.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Preventing Corrosion With Coatings</h2> \n<p>Another difference between aluminum and steel roofing is that steel will still look appealing in an uncoated state. Uncoated aluminum often becomes less attractive as it ages, and as a thinner, more lightweight material, it's more susceptible to oxidation and pitting.</p> \n<p>Aluminum is generally the better choice for coastal locations since plain steel is vulnerable to corrosion and rust. However, steel can be galvanized by applying a zinc coating to the metal's surface. In addition to corrosion and rust resistance, galvanization protects against UV rays and weathering. For even more protection, galvalume steel utilizes a zinc and aluminum coating. Your residential customers may only picture a metal roof as silver, but steel roofing is available in a variety of colors — even red, blue and green — thanks to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.becn.com/productDetail/C-342602\">attractive acrylic coatings</a>.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Gauge and Thickness</h2> \n<p>Roofers can also educate their customers about metal gauges. Lighter 24-gauge steel may offer the same protection of 22-gauge at a reduced weight. At its heaviest, steel weighs about 1.5 pounds per square foot, according to <a href=\"https://www.hometownroofingcontractors.com/blog/metal-roofing-steel-vs-aluminum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hometown Roofing Contractors</a>. It's considered to be a lightweight product, particularly when compared to asphalt. On the other hand, aluminum is even lighter than steel and offers a high strength-to-weight ratio. It's also more bendable and therefore easier to work with onsite.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Location, Location, Location</h2> \n<p>In the end, the needs and location of the project will dictate which metal roofing material is most appropriate. Building near the ocean? Rust-resistant aluminum might be a better choice, as long as hurricanes are not a concern. Repairing a roof in the path of brush fires? Steel may be the best option.</p> \n<p>Englert adds that if a contractor is adding a metal roof over an older layer of shingles and is concerned about the home's structure supporting the added weight, either light-gauge steel or aluminum could work. Consider all of these variables and help your customers make the best choice for a sturdy and attractive new metal roof. </p>",

Solar roofing makes sense in terms of efficiency and profitability, and the roofing contractor is the best person suited to install it.",
            "title": "Roofing and Solar: Capitalizing on the Latest Energy-Saving Technologies",
            "body": "<p>Thanks in part to a burgeoning market with new and affordable technologies, more and more roofing contractors are well-positioned to offer their clients installations that combine roofing and solar.</p> \n<p>Roofing business owners can profit from solar technologies on a number of levels. Companies can partner with solar installers to perform the roof penetrations and flashings, while agreeing to share leads. Roofing companies with greater installation expertise can partner with or provide labor-only installation services to solar companies. Contractors that have achieved some level of scale (two or more crews) can subcontract out the electrical or partner with an electrician until their volume of work justifies bringing an electrician in-house. Since leaking roof penetrations are a leading cause of problems with rooftop solar, roofing contractors can also find work handling repairs on residential and commercial solar projects. </p> \n<p>If you're excited by the prospect of a roofing and solar market but are uncertain about your first steps, here are a few tips.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Gauging the Health of the Solar Market</h2> \n<p>The three key drivers in the solar market are available sunlight (or insolation), electricity costs and incentives. Cool, sunny climates like Southern California are ideal for solar. However, if electricity costs are low and incentives are in place, the amount of insolation becomes less critical. For example, one of the fastest growing regions in the U.S. for solar roofing is the Northeast, where the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> reports electricity costs range from $0.15 to $0.25 per kilowatt-hour.</p> \n<p>Another plus for solar roofing is that industry growth and increased competition have created a greater degree of commoditization and standardization of products: Equipment and products are more readily available for contractors, and more commonplace for consumers. Hopefully, financing solutions for solar will soon become similarly standardized.</p> \n<p>Other areas that will help drive up solar roofing productivity and reduce costs are lower sales costs and innovations in software. New software solutions that help with customer relationship management (CRM), system design, integrated financing, project management and proposal creation can help contractors integrate complex solar sales into an existing business.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">The Time to Consider Solar Is Now</h2> \n<p>With the step-down and <a href=\"https://earthtechling.com/solar-energy-costs-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expiration of the federal investment tax credit</a>, there's no point in delaying an entry into the solar roofing market. The tax credit is 30% of the cost of the solar roofing system in 2019, but will shrink to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021 and 10% in 2022. After 2022, homeowners can no longer claim the solar tax credit.</p> \n<p class=\"left\">The commercial solar tax credit is the same as the residential credit up until the end of 2021. When the tax credit expires for homeowners, the commercial solar tax credit <a href=\"https://news.energysage.com/congress-extends-the-solar-tax-credit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drops and remains fixed at 10%</a> barring new legislation.</p> \n<p class=\"left\">However, incentives often differ at the state level. Contractors should check the <a href=\"https://www.dsireusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency</a> for incentives in their local markets.</p> \n<h2 class=\"left\">Consider the Scale of Your Business</h2> \n<p class=\"left\">Contractors must critically examine their roofing businesses' core strengths before embarking on any type of solar venture. A focus on excellent customer service, quality control, project management and intensive employee training positions a company to sell and install solar roof systems successfully. Adding on the electrical expertise is a minor task compared to developing the core values needed to succeed in solar roofing. Developing strategic relationships with a financial partner and a strong sales channel partner is another key to success.</p> \n<p class=\"left\">In order to prioritize simple solutions for homeowners, contractors may want to consider leasing rooftop solar panels. This is an appealing solution that allows customers to lock in cheaper energy costs for 20 years or more. Otherwise, <a href=\"https://snapfinance.com/what-does-same-as-cash-mean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same-as-cash financing</a> may be necessary to close a residential sale.</p> \n<p class=\"left\">It's also important that budding roofing and solar installers are not distracted by large-scale commercial projects as they continue to grow and optimize their residential business. Meanwhile, larger commercial roofing contractors may move directly into installing more complex solar arrays, adhered thin-film panels and newer bifacial modules on low-slope roofs.</p> \n<p class=\"left\">When you're considering adding solar to your offerings, keep your roofing company's strengths and weaknesses in mind. Solar can be a great investment, but your sales, project management and technological aptitude all have to be strong to make it work.</p>",

            "title": "Ensure Your Next Project Meets the Latest Roof Building Codes",
            "body": "<p>Despite great strides toward unifying roof building codes throughout the U.S., the idea of roofing contractors having to learn just one set of codes is still a distant dream. All 50 states have adopted the <a href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/2018-i-codes/ibc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Building Code</a> (IBC), but enforcement largely remains a local issue. Many municipal codes vary widely, especially on wind resistance requirements.</p> \n<p>It often takes a disaster before the importance of building codes hits home. While states like Louisiana adopted the IBC, several parishes along the Gulf Coast did not adopt the wind and flood requirements prior to Hurricane Katrina. Several critics suggested that organizations <a href=\"https://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/rebuilt-new-orleans-must-adopt-building-codes/6080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rebuilding New Orleans</a> and other areas should keep a keener eye on codes.</p> \n<p>\"We know what can be done,\" former FEMA head Craig Fugate told <a href=\"https://www.wjct.org/2018/10/after-hurricane-michael-a-call-for-stricter-building-codes-in-floridas-panhandle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NPR</a> after Hurricane Michael in 2018. The key question is \"whether a community is willing to adopt it or not.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IBC2015/chapter-15-roof-assemblies-and-rooftop-structures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Section 1507.2</a> of the IBC covers the requirements for installing asphalt shingles. None of the requirements should come as a surprise to a roofing professional. However, contractors should pay special attention to the code interpretation and letter of all IBC, state and local codes and incorporate them into their installation practices.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">A Systems Approach to Roof Design</h2> \n<p>One way residential contractors can ensure they're meeting roof building codes is to simply follow the installation requirements provided by roofing manufacturers. Failing to meet these requirements is considered a code violation. Using the recommended underlayments, leak barriers, ridge vents and starter strips that accompany the chosen shingle style is a good first step toward meeting local wind, fire and roof ventilation code requirements.</p> \n<p>Currently, most manufacturers' asphalt roof shingles are capable of passing the industry's <a href=\"https://beta.nrca.net/roofing/ASTM-International-s-roofing-and-waterproofing-related-test-methods-254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two toughest wind resistance tests</a>: ASTM D3161, Class F (110 mph) and ASTM D7158, Class H (150 mph). Unless you're working with an off-brand product or one that deviates from the manufacturer's \"systems\" approach to roof design, you can be assured that the shingles being used will meet the rigorous local codes currently in place in most areas of the U.S.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Local Requirements for Ventilation</h2> \n<p>As for ventilation, the U.S. Federal Housing Authority recommends a minimum of at least one square foot of attic ventilation (evenly split between intake and exhaust) for every 300 square feet of attic floor space. An online ventilation calculator will instantly produce the ventilation requirements while offering a variety of product solutions.</p> \n<p>When climate or building design demands increased ventilation due to humidity and temperature fluctuations, the requirements should be spelled out in the local code. A quick internet search should reveal everything the installer needs to know about local wind and ventilation requirements. If anything is unclear, the contractor should consult a local design professional.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Code Enforcement</h2> \n<p>Direct intervention by local code officials often increases with the size of the roofing project. Code officials also have the final say on roofing specifications.</p> \n<p>One common example is the number of nails or staples required per shingle. Especially on ultra-heavyweight products, code officials may require six or eight fasteners, while the roofing manufacturer may be adamant on four fasteners per shingle to maintain the structural integrity of the product. However, outside the courtroom, the code official's word is law. In coastal areas, particularly in California and Florida, local codes may require more fasteners than specified by the shingle manufacturer.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Code Certification Programs for Roofers</h2> \n<p>For those looking to further their knowledge on roof building codes, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/professional-development/certificationexams/\">International Code Council</a> offers a contractor examination and code certification program. The voluntary written or online test lets contractors demonstrate their knowledge in various areas of code enforcement, then check their scores online. It's an easy way to test how much you really know and spot areas where you need to brush up.</p> \n<p>Remember that building codes are the minimum requirements. Residential roofing professionals should be prepared to install \"above code\" when good roofing practice warrants it. For most residential contractors, meeting local building codes is often a matter of common sense.</p>",

            "title": "Questions to Ask a Roofer: How to Pick the Right Roofer for Your Needs",
            "body": "<p>Your roof has a big job to do. It protects your home and family from water, wind, excessive sunlight and snow. It keeps birds, squirrels and other critters from staking a claim inside your house. It plays a big role in keeping your home warm in winter and cool in the summer.</p> \n<p>If you need to repair or replace your roof, you want to be sure it's in the right hands. Knowing what questions to ask a roofer can help you find the contractor who will best meet your needs. Here's what to ask and why.</p> \n<h2>1. Who Works for Your Company?</h2> \n<p>Roofers work in crews. That means the person who answers the phone or makes a site visit won't be the only one working on the job. Some questions to ask a roofer should focus on the people they work with. Where do they find and hire their subcontractors, and can they provide you with their contact information? If the company hires employees, do they pay them a fair wage?</p> \n<p>Worker safety should be important to the contractor you hire. Ask them what they use to protect their workers on the job, such as safety harnesses and <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provide fall protection training</a>. </p> \n<h2>2. What Manufacturers Do You Work With?</h2> \n<p>It's a good idea to learn about the manufacturers or distributors a roofer uses. As with any other product, some roofing material manufacturers have a better reputation than others. In many cases, companies with better reputations offer warranties, as they have an excellent track record and reliable products. Learning which manufacturers your contractor works with can also give you an idea of the warranty you can expect on your new shingles or other roofing materials.</p> \n<h2>3. Do You Work With My Roofing Material?</h2> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/roofing/buying-guide/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consumer Reports</a> notes, asphalt shingles are the most popular roofing choice. But they aren't the only material out there. If you want something different from basic asphalt, it's important to verify that a roofer has experience with that material. For example, you may need a contractor with masonry experience to install slate. If you want tile, rubber shingles or another specialty material, learn more about a contractor's experience first.</p> \n<h2>4. Are You Local?</h2> \n<p>A roofing contractor should understand the challenges specific to your area or climate, such as weather and pest control. They should also be a phone call and quick drive away if you run into problems with your roof a year or two down the road. Choose a roofing contractor who is part of your community, and not just someone who's in town cleaning up after a storm.</p> \n<h2>5. How Do I Pay You?</h2> \n<p>A reputable contractor won't usually ask for the full price of an expensive roofing project upfront. If someone demands full payment before work begins, consider that a warning that things won't go as planned.</p> \n<p>Ideally, a contractor's payment schedule will line up with the project timeline. You might pay a small amount upfront, then make another payment when the project is halfway complete and a final payment when everything is finished. Ask potential roofing matches what their usual payment schedule looks like.</p> \n<p>Finally, don't sign a roofing company's contract until you're sure what it means. Sit down with any potential contractors and ask them to review the contract with you. If they're offering a warranty, ask about what's covered and for how long.</p> \n<p>Working with the right contractor can mean the difference between a project that goes better than expected and one that goes off the rails. Along with getting the full scoop on any contractor you're considering working with, trust your instincts. If you feel like you haven't found the perfect roofer for the job, you might be better off continuing your search.</p>",

            "body": "<p>There are many roofers today who never planned on a roofing career, but are thriving in their chosen field. Unfortunately, it's not a trade that is usually promoted in high schools or even trade schools. That attitude is beginning to change.</p> \n<p> Individual roofers and groups like the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) have been working to not only get the word out about what a great opportunity a roofing career is, but also provide some hard facts about the long-term potential of a career in roofing. Here are five reasons to listen to their advice and climb into your next job.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">1. Develop a Lifelong Career</h2> \n<p>Learning a trade like roofing is a career path that can start on the jobsite and move into the office, or into other opportunities like distribution and manufacturing. The opportunities are limitless for a well-trained and hardworking person.</p> \n<p>Continuing education is on the rise in the roofing industry. There has always been strong training within roofing companies, but now the industry is experiencing increased opportunities through associations like the <a href=\"http://www.nrca.net/education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NRCA University</a> and manufacturer programs. Extra courses and learning opportunities help both new recruits and seasoned vets improve their skills.</p> \n<p>In fact, a great reason to look at a career in roofing now is the opportunity to get certified. Roofing craftspeople can take a test to prove the quality of their work and receive certification status with the <a href=\"http://www.nrca.net/procertification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NRCA ProCertification</a>. It's a sign of quality and trade excellence that will propel any career and increase salary ranges.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">2. Earn a Good Living</h2> \n<p>Roofers can expect to work hard physically and risk the occasional injury, but a good hourly wage or monthly salary is part of the roofing industry. Roofing contractors are looking for talented craftspeople who can deliver quality work, and many are willing to pay top dollar. With certifications and experience, your wages will only increase.</p> \n<p>According to the NRCA, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472181.htm#nat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">average wage of roofing field workers</a> is over $43,000 per year, with opportunities for much higher salaries after time and training.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">3. Stay Active</h2> \n<p>If you're someone who doesn't like to sit still or be stuck inside, roofing might be perfect for you. The opportunity to work outside, get exercise and create a beautiful, sound structure delivers a sense of accomplishment and will help keep you physically fit and active.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">4. Learn About Technology</h2> \n<p>The old days of pen, paper and clipboards are quickly vanishing. Being proficient in technology like smartphone apps, drones and robotics can position new roofing professionals in some of the top technician jobs in the industry. Meanwhile, burgeoning industrial advances like solar roof tiles are becoming critical to the growth and sustainability of the industry and opening new job opportunities.</p> \n<p>Roofing offers a unique opportunity to embrace technology while working in a very traditional trade. The industry will be looking for the next generation of smart, curious recruits to bring efficiencies to the rooftop and brainstorm solutions for contractors.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">5. Make Your Crew Your Family</h2> \n<p>Although money is important, roofing business owners are beginning to understand that job culture is also critical. Employees are looking for jobs that fit their talent, skills and lifestyle. Any seasoned roofer will talk over and over again about the family of roofing. The industry is tight-knit and welcoming.</p> \n<p>Although roofers may not always have had the best reputation, the reality is that they are a group comprising committed, professional and welcoming tradespeople who see it as their job to keep families and businesses safe. Being part of such a widespread, passionate network is one of the greatest benefits of roofing.</p>",

            "title": "Inflatable Fall Arrest Bags: The Next Step in Roofing Safety?",
            "body": "<p>In the roofing industry, and construction in general, falls are one of the major threats to workers' health and safety. About one-third of all fatalities in construction are due to falls, according to the <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3146.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).</p> \n<p>You're already familiar with fall protection options like guardrails and safety nets, but several organizations are working on a new option: inflatable fall arrest systems. While not as widely available as rails or personal harnesses, inflatable fall arrest bags and harnesses might be used in the future to protect workers in certain conditions.</p> \n<h2>Are Inflatable Fall Protection Options Legit?</h2> \n<p>OSHA outlines the requirements for fall protection systems in standard <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=10758&amp;p_table=STANDARDS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1926.502</a>. This standard describes the guardrails, safety nets and personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) that can be used to prevent accidents.</p> \n<p>Although the standard does not explicitly mention inflatable fall protection systems or airbags, a <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1995-03-15-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1995 standard interpretation from OSHA</a> suggests that if an inflatable fall arrest device meets the safety net standard's criteria, and if it can prevent a test weight from hitting the ground, OSHA would consider it acceptable fall protection. However, the 1995 interpretation was describing airbags, not personal fall arrest systems designed to be worn by workers.</p> \n<p>Although there are a few patents for inflatable fall arrest bags and some wearable airbags, none of them is a tried-and-true substitute for nets, guardrails or harnesses on a jobsite.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Harnesses, Crash Pads and Belts</h2> \n<p>Any fall protection system used at a jobsite needs to meet OSHA requirements. For example, an inflatable airbag used in place of a traditional safety net would need to be the right size based on the roof's height.</p> \n<p>The airbag also needs to completely cover the fall area. One current option on the market, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i2kairpad.com/fall-protection/\">i2KAirbags</a>, is advertised for use in narrow spaces, such as between two buildings or next to a vehicle. However, if you're working across the roof of a two- or three-story home, surrounding the whole house with crash pads might not be a practical solution.</p> \n<p>Along with covering a large area, an inflatable fall protection device needs to sufficiently break a person's fall. Several designers have proposed wearable, inflatable devices similar to a traditional PFAS harness. One, the Free Fall harness, is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/11232605/Free-Fall-Tool-Harness-and-Airbag-System\">still in the prototype stage</a>, while the other is designed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/small_business/active-protective-airbag-belt-genesis-healthcare-20180316.html\">protect senior citizens from hip fractures</a> and would have to be adapted for construction use. Both work by inflating a network of airbags that surround a person's body as they fall. </p> \n<h2><strong>The Future of Inflatable Fall Protection</strong></h2> \n<p>Although the options for inflatable fall arrest bags and harnesses are limited, they might one day be an appropriate option to protect your team from falls. </p> \n<p>If it ever gets off the ground, an inflatable fall protection system might be affordable and portable for roofers who are just starting out. Several companies that design and produce fall protection airbags allow you to rent rather than purchase them outright. The devices' ability to inflate and deflate might make them relatively easy to store and transport between jobsites.</p> \n<p>In the roofing industry, it is critical that you do whatever you can to protect your team from falls. Until inflatable airbags are widely available and proven to be safe, a well-fitting PFAS might be the best option to keep your workers safe on the job.</p>",

            "body": "<p>In the spring of 2019, the world watched as Notre Dame burned. Early reports from <a href=\"https://time.com/5571554/paris-fire-notre-dame-shock-damage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Time</a> stated that the fire may have started in the upper roof section, where construction was ongoing. Some experts speculated to French journalists that the initial cause might have been a spark from a welder's torch, although there is no proof for their theory. In any event, welding safety for roofers should be top of mind.</p> \n<p>Similar fire tragedies have been repeated on many smaller roofs under construction, whether due to torch-down applications, welding difficulties or accidents with flammable materials. When roofing contractors see a need for metal welding on the roof, it's important that all employees are properly trained to protect the building and, most importantly, to prevent accidents and injuries.</p> \n<p>If you are not an expert in welding safety, there are many sources for training and education, including the <a title=\" American Welding Society (AWS)\" href=\"https://awo.aws.org/online-courses/safety-in-welding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Welding Society (AWS)</a>. Any roofers who are going to be welding regularly must have appropriate safety training. Companies like <a title=\"Welding Safety\" href=\"https://safetyculture.com/topics/welding-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iAuditor</a> also provide resources that can support your safety program.</p> \n<p>Before your roofing company takes on any welding job, make sure you're prepared. That includes having a fire watch individual with an appropriately sized fire extinguisher present, and obtaining a hot work permit if the property owner or company policy requires one. </p> \n<p>Here are four basic tenets of welding safety for roofers that can keep buildings and employees safe.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong style=\"color: #333f48;\">1. Clear Hazards From the Area</strong></h2> \n<p>Before beginning a rooftop welding project, all workers should investigate the surrounding area for safety hazards, and clear the roof within 35 feet of the rig if possible. Move <a href=\"https://awo.aws.org/2016/08/five-tips-for-preventing-welding-fires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all flammable materials</a> like wood, bundles of shingles, cardboard boxes, rags, paper bags, dry leaves, gas cylinders, wood, paint and solvents far from the welding area.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong style=\"color: #333f48;\">2. Cover Cracks, Gaps and Holes</strong></h2> \n<p>Small openings like pipe holes and cracks can be a significant fire hazard if they catch a drip of molten metal. A flying spark can lodge in the tiniest of cracks and smolder for minutes before it's noticed. When you're checking a roof for hazards, identify any small holes or gaps, and cover them with nonflammable material or set up nonflammable screens.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>3. Prevent Electric Shock</strong></h2> \n<p class=\"\">Be sure to inspect all welding equipment, especially the electrode holder, before proceeding with work. Never touch the metal part of the electrode holder with skin or wet clothing. Electrocution can be a serious risk to welders when there is a sudden discharge of electricity. Emphasize to your crew that electrical fires happen every day, and that regular equipment maintenance is a critical safety step.<strong><br></strong></p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>4. Dress for Fire Safety<br></strong></h2> \n<p>You may not think of a shirt and pants as personal protective equipment, but a roofer's clothes are an important part of welding safety. According to the AWS, a stray spark \"can easily become lodged in the crevices of rolled-up sleeves, [shirt collars], pant cuffs or pockets\" and start a fire. Anyone welding on a roof should wear the appropriate flame resistant (FR) clothing, such as a welding jacket and FR pants. FR clothing is made from natural materials, usually cotton. Avoid synthetic fabrics like polyester, which <a href=\"http://www.wcb.pe.ca/DocumentManagement/Document/pub_fireretardantclothingrequirements.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can melt onto the skin</a> and cause severe burns.</p> \n<p>Overexposure to welding fumes and gases can also endanger a roofer. Make sure all crew members who are welding and working nearby are using respirators if necessary. And, of course, your fire watch worker should always be nearby to put out any fires in the early stages.</p> \n<p>Whenever you are welding on a roof, employees always need to be aware of fire danger and take appropriate precautions. Following a few basic steps, every time, can help protect your crew and the jobsite.</p>",

            "title": "5 Ways to Maintain Quality Roof Standards, Even When Business Is Booming",
            "body": "<p>Maintaining quality roof standards is a priority for your residential roofing business, no matter how busy you are. However, it can be a challenge to deliver tiptop service and craftsmanship when your crews are quickly moving from job to job. You may even be bringing in independent contractors who are less than familiar with your quality control processes.</p> \n<p>If your work's quality comes into question, it could result in expensive rework. Be sure to maintain consistent quality standards and use quality products to help manage customer satisfaction.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Train Your Workers on Materials and Quality Standards</h2> \n<p>One step toward pursuing quality and consistency is ensuring you have workers certified in each type of roof system. Many industry organizations, such as the National Roofing Contractors Association, have <a href=\"http://www.nrca.net/procertification/certifications/benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certification programs</a> you can take advantage of.</p> \n<p>It also pays off to ensure your roofers are factory-installed certified. Supplier-specific training sets up your crew for a consistent and professional installation. Check with your distributor to see if they offer certification programs.</p> \n<p>Implement quality control and quality assurance standards to be applied on every job — quality control defines the standards to be met, while quality assurance tells you how. Quality assurance might include setting time aside for inspection requirements or double-checking that the materials used met the project requirements. Remind your roofing crews that quality standards matter before, during and after the work is completed.</p> \n<h2>Keep the Jobsite Clean and Efficient</h2> \n<p>For every job, assign a crew lead who can oversee jobsite efficiency and keep the work area clean and organized. This person can take the lead on managing the project's timeline to prevent delays that would affect the next roofing job. Your crew lead or project manager can be crucial in ensuring all work is proceeding within the project specifications and that the right materials are being used.</p> \n<p>Your point of contact for jobsite efficiency can also be in charge of a quality roof tear-off and cleanup job. Work with them to make a plan for protecting flower beds, outbuildings or other items from debris dropping off the roof. Create a debris removal plan, such as laying out tarps to catch falling material and sweeping the drop zone with a magnet to collect any loose nails before you leave the site. An efficient and tidy jobsite makes it easier for your crew to maintain quality standards.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Managing Quality for Residential Roofing Contractors</h2> \n<p>Your crew should be clear on company standards and procedures. Make sure they're taking the time to measure and install according to your business' specifications, and treating every client with a high standard of courtesy and professionalism.</p> \n<p>Quality isn't just about offering a solid product or service — it's about your reputation for delivering a consistent customer experience, no matter how jam-packed your schedule is.</p>",

            "title": "How to Identify and Take Care of a Leaking Roof",
            "body": "<p>A leaking roof can be a big headache for homeowners. The good news is that consistently checking for signs of a leak — and then contacting a professional roofing contractor if you find one — can often relieve you of this headache, and not necessarily at an exorbitant price.</p> \n<p>The longer a leaking roof goes unaddressed, the greater the risk of further problems. Issues can range from mildew and mold to serious water damage inside the house. That's why it's so important to be alert to possible roof leaks and know when to take action.</p> \n<h2>Common Causes of Roof Leaks</h2> \n<p>Here are some of the most common causes to look out for:</p> \n<p><strong>A crack in the flashing. </strong>Flashing is designed to close gaps around features like gutters, skylights or chimneys where water can collect and cause potential damage. A missing nail or dried-up adhesive can cause these metal strips to slip out of place, paving the way for possible leaks.</p> \n<p><strong>Damaged shingles. </strong>Like all other materials, asphalt shingles are subject to wear and tear from the weather and other factors. A cracked shingle is a fairly obvious cause of a leaking roof, and is often easy to identify from the ground.</p> \n<p><strong>Ice dams. </strong>After a severe winter storm, melting snow can gather at the roof's edges and refreeze. This causes blocks of frozen slush called ice dams, which push water up under the shingles where it can seep into decking and your attic ceiling.</p> \n<p><strong>Debris in gutters. </strong>If your house is surrounded by trees, your roof can easily collect debris like leaves, branches and twigs. These pileups clog the water's flow to a point where the gutters can't channel water away from the roof the way they are designed to. Instead, water seeps under the shingles and causes leaks.</p> \n<h2>Indoor and Outdoor Signs of a Leaking Roof</h2> \n<p>Sometimes, water damage is visible before you can spot the leak itself. After extreme weather or when the seasons change, take a walk around your house and look at the roof and gutters. You can safely examine your roof for damage while standing on a ladder, but don't walk around up top without a contractor's safety equipment. It pays to check for these common problems:</p> \n<p><strong>Patches of missing asphalt granules. </strong>With asphalt shingles, underlying granules can sometimes come loose, leaving bald patches on the roof. Unprotected spots can be a clear sign that something's wrong. You may need to take a picture of a section of shingles and zoom in on the image on a phone or desktop to spot small issues. </p> \n<p><strong>Water pooling in gutters. </strong>A debris-clogged gutter might fill up with water and overflow. Watch for water leaking from gutter seams or broken drainpipes as well.</p> \n<p><strong>Stained soffits and fascia. </strong>The boards protecting the roof's lower edge and underside are called soffits and fascia. Because they protect the gap between the roof and walls, stains or disrepair can be a sign that water is already seeping in.</p> \n<p><strong>Water stains inside the house. </strong>A large water stain on the ceiling is an obvious sign of a leak. After a heavy rainstorm, it's a good idea to do a visual inspection inside the house, especially your attic or top floor, to check for any stains. Knocking on discolored areas with a broom handle can also reveal any wet, spongy areas that need immediate attention.</p> \n<p>Most homeowners lack the skill or knowledge to repair a damaged or leaking roof on their own. The key to saving money in the long run is to immediately contact <a href=\"https://www.beaconroofingsupply.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an experienced roofing contractor</a> to schedule an inspection. The contractor will look closely at each potential problem area, and advise on any repairs or shoring up. When small problems are handled promptly, they won't grow into bigger, costlier issues later on.</p>",

            "title": "Crafting Your Roofing Sales Pitch for Millennial Homebuyers",
            "body": "<p>Understanding the generation that comes after yours is often a challenge. As more millennials become homeowners, roofing companies and sales teams need to understand what's important to this generation. Knowing what younger homeowners want from a relationship with their contractor can help you craft a roofing sales pitch for a millennial audience.</p> \n<h2>Working Millennials Are Buying Homes</h2> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew Research Center</a> analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, millennials make up 35% of American workers, making them the largest generation in the U.S. labor force. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> also shares that 36.4% of homeowners are now 35 years old or younger. That's around <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/98729/millennial_homeownership.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 percentage points lower</a> than baby boomers' and Gen Xers' homeownership rates at the same age, but one-third of homeowners are still looking for contractors to maintain and repair their homes.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.residentialdesignmagazine.com/15027/survey-shows-millennials-growing-impact-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HomeAdvisor</a>, millennials are more likely to remodel their homes and take on multiple DIY projects than any other generation. With challenges like student loan debt, lower marriage rates and overall economic pressures, the next generation is buying older homes in need of repair in order to afford homeownership. They are not just looking for a re-roofing service, but also a longer relationship with a contractor that is based on mutual learning and respect.</p> \n<h2>What Millennials Want From Roofing Companies</h2> \n<p>Studies show that millennials want to work with companies <a href=\"https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2018/02/20/millennials-want-workplaces-social-purpose-company-measure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that are focused on equality</a> and social responsibility. Millennials and members of Generation Z (the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-profile-2017-9#this-preference-for-inclusion-extends-to-policy-surrounding-marriage-although-gen-z-is-largely-too-young-to-be-thinking-about-marriage-themselves-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">racially and gender-diverse</a> generation following millennials that has just begun to graduate from college) are also considering their communities more expansively.</p> \n<p>In the context of a roofing sales pitch, roofing contractors need to look at heightened diversity in gender, age and race in their companies, especially in sales and marketing. Hire a sales team that not only reflects your customer base, but can break down stereotypes of what they think these young homeowners may want.</p> \n<h2>Adjusting Your Sales Pitch for Younger Clients</h2> \n<p>Start by encouraging your sales team to seek out educational opportunities — classes in diversity and unconscious bias, along with more research on a younger audience, will be critical for future sales success. Create a roofing sales pitch that is more informational and educational, helping young homeowners understand the importance of the building materials that protect their homes. Embracing a younger client set may also lead to more inspections and face-to-face time to connect with potential customers.</p> \n<p>With millennials taking the lead in buying old fixer-uppers over new homes, it's evident that many are looking for more than a quick solution: They need help finding the tools and time to make a good decision. They are also looking for salespeople and companies that know how to communicate using technology, so utilizing digital planning and visual tools will become more important.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that millennial customers are likely to be language diverse. Around 17% are bilingual, according to the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-jan_brookings-metro_millennials-a-demographic-bridge-to-americas-diverse-future.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brookings Institute</a>, and a quarter speak a language other than English at home. Knowing a few words of Spanish or Chinese can be vital for maintaining clear communication from a technical standpoint.</p> \n<p>Finally, be transparent and understand what matters to a client. Whether it's environmentally sustainable building products or diverse company ownership, the buyers of tomorrow will be looking at your company, products and causes. Be sure that your company culture is aligned with their priorities in a way that fosters a long-term relationship, so that you are their first call for more than just a starter home.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "Homeowners will understand how to maintain a clay roof.",
            "title": "How to Maintain Clay Roof Tiles",
            "body": "<p>With origins dating back thousands of years, clay roof tiles are a durable, attractive and low maintenance building material. Today, this roofing material can be made from naturally occurring clay that is baked at high temperatures in a kiln to protect its hardness and color. Tile roofs can be an investment, and are often more popular in specific regions like the Mediterranean and the Southwestern U.S. where their style has a historic or cultural connection.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Clay</h2> \n<p>Clay roofing is gaining in popularity and anticipated to grow 7.8 percent per year to be valued at $145 million by 2020, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ceramicindustry.com/articles/96077-rebounding-residential-construction-offers-opportunities-for-clay-roofing-tile\">Ceramic Industry</a> magazine. Why is it such an appealing option? Clay roof tiles are environmentally friendly, as they're easy to recycle, are often sourced from local materials and utilize responsible manufacturing processes. They also offer long-term color consistency and a nonporous surface that inhibits algae and mold growth.</p> \n<p>While there's a lot to love here, clay tiles do come with a hefty price tag for materials, labor and installation. The good news is that, as a highly durable material requiring little maintenance, the vast majority of the investment in a clay roof is at the front end. It helps that a clay tile roof can last up to 75 years, notes the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.interstatebrick.com/sites/default/files/library/nahb20study20of20life20expectancy20of20home20components.pdf\">National Association of Home Builders</a>.</p> \n<p>A standard clay roof usually costs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.roofcostestimator.com/concrete-vs-clay-roof-tile-cost/\">between $11 and $18 per square foot</a>, while fancier tile options can cost as much as $30 per square foot. For a typical 2,000-square-foot roof, the cost will run between $25,000 and $45,000 to install, according to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.roofingcalc.com/tile-roof-cost/\">Roofing Calculator</a>. The choice of material, location and installation difficulty of your individual roof may shift this price up or down.</p> \n<p>The tiles themselves can be extruded to form nearly any shape. Some common styles include half-pipe barrel tiles laid in vertical rows of half-circles, and S-shaped tiles that overlap across the rooftop. While terracotta is a common color choice, enamels can be added in to create different hues ranging from brown to green.</p> \n<h2>Maintaining a Tile Roof</h2> \n<p>Clay roof tiles generally require little maintenance, but they are sometimes prone to cracking after freeze-thaw cycles in colder regions. Otherwise, maintenance is generally limited to cleaning the gutters, repairing flashing or removing debris from roof valleys.</p> \n<p>In the rare case that tiles are damaged, it may only be necessary to replace the broken pieces rather than replacing the whole roof. However, accessing them can be tricky. Walking on a tile roof may cause more tiles to break and can be dangerously slippery. The difficulty of accessing a tile roof is the main reason why you should hire a professional roofing contractor for any repairs. </p> \n<p>Additionally, clay tile installation is more complicated than a nail-gunned row of asphalt shingles. Tiles may be hung on nails that pass through pre-drilled holes into a strip of wood, glued down with roofing cement or set in mortar. When you look for a contractor, sleuth out someone who has documented experience working with multiple types of clay tile roofs.</p> \n<p>Installing clay roof tiles may seem daunting, but the curbside appeal and low maintenance factor make this type of roofing a choice to consider for your home. </p> \n<p><br></p>",

            "body": "<p>Remember the old TV adage \"don't try this at home\"? That goes for roofing as well.</p> \n<p>While it may seem like everyone is undertaking DIY home repair projects these days, hiring a roofing contractor will actually save a homeowner time, money and a lot of regret in the long run. It can even be critical for preventing injuries to you and your roof.</p> \n<p>Read on for a few reasons to put your ladder back in the garage and pick up the phone instead.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong></strong>Fall Safety</h2> \n<p>Roofing is dangerous. According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html\">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA), one-fifth of all worker fatalities in the United States in 2017 were in the construction industry, and falling was the leading cause of deaths. Other <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OSHA studies</a> have found that falling from a roof causes one-third of fall fatalities.</p> \n<p> It goes without saying that it's even riskier for non-professionals. By ditching the DIY and hiring a roofing contractor, you get a professional who has undergone extensive safety training, uses proper safety equipment and, most importantly, has the right insurance to cover any accidents, including workers' compensation and general liability insurance.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">A Job Done Right</h2> \n<p>Roofing systems are complex; a roof comprises several layers that work together to protect your home. Hiring a roofing contractor will ensure the proper installation of each component, which protects not only your roof from wind, rain, ice, heat and humidity, but also your attic, walls and foundation.</p> \n<p>If you decide to go rogue and fix an existing roof, you could end up voiding the terms and conditions of your existing roofing warranty. Most warranties have a clause prohibiting unauthorized repairs.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\"><strong></strong>Quality and Aesthetics</h2> \n<p>Repairing or installing an attractive new roof isn't as easy as it looks on TV. Unless you have the right tools and skills, your DIY attempt could result in crooked or misaligned shingles that create a mismatched, patchwork-quilt effect on your roof — which will neither impress your neighbors nor increase your home's curb appeal.</p> \n<p>A recent survey from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.improvenet.com/2019-home-improvement-statistics\">ImproveNet</a> exposes the ugly truth of going the DIY route on a home improvement project: Nearly two out of three people surveyed said they regretted undertaking a home improvement project, and one in three admitted they had to call in a professional to redo the job. These homeowners' biggest project disappointment? More than half of the respondents (55 percent) said the final project didn't look good and 24 percent said it didn't function well.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Leave Your Roofing Job to the Professionals</h2> \n<p>Remember, roof work is no HGTV project. Attempting to install or repair your own roof can be hazardous, costly and potentially unsightly. Homeowners should think twice before doing even \"just a little\" roofing repair on their own. Look for an experienced contractor in your area who can advise you on roofing materials, installation and maintenance, and you'll be far happier with the results.</p>",

            "title": "Chimney Repair for Residential Roofers",
            "body": "<p>Fall is in the air, along with pumpkins and thick sweaters, and homeowners will soon want to fire up their fireplaces. But what if they find out they need a chimney repair? They will undoubtedly turn to their trusted residential roofing professional for guidance. Are you ready to advise your residential clients on chimney parts and problems? Here are a few terms and skills to brush up on.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Getting Familiar With Chimneys</h2> \n<p>A chimney is part of a roofing system, so it's important for roofing professionals to understand its components.</p> \n<p><strong>Flue</strong>: The internal duct, pipe or opening that carries gases and smoke from the fire to the outdoors. The chimney itself can also be a flue, but for safety reasons, it's better to have a separate metal lining or flue.</p> \n<p><strong>Flue cap</strong>: A lid that goes over the chimney or flue to protect it from weather and debris. It can also include a mesh screen to prevent animals from getting in.</p> \n<p><strong>Crown</strong>: A concrete lid that covers the entire top opening of the chimney to protect the masonry from water damage.</p> \n<p><strong>Chimney chase</strong>: The external and most visible part of the chimney, usually brick. It releases smoke and embers away from the roof.</p> \n<p><strong>Base flashing (also called step flashing</strong><strong>)</strong>: Weatherproof metal strips installed along the base of the chimney where it meets the shingles and attaches to the roofline. Flashing should extend out from the base by 3 to 6 inches and up the side of the chimney by 9 to 12 inches, according to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ashireporter.org/HomeInspection/Articles/Chimney-Flashings/2413\">American Society of Home Inspectors</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Cap flashing (also called counter flashing)</strong>: Attached to the chimney (not the roof), cap flashing is a finishing metal strip that lays over the base flashing and provides an extra layer of flexible weather protection. It is attached to the chimney and sealed with butyl rubber or polyurethane caulking.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Signs of Chimney Damage</h2> \n<p>There are many signs that a chimney needs repair, including water stains or leaks, rust on metal components such as the firebox or damper, smoke blowing indoors or even unexpected bricks in your client's backyard. Here are a few of the most common causes for chimney problems:</p> \n<p><strong>Blockages</strong>: Debris, or even birds and other critters, can clog the flue, causing smoke to blow back into a fireplace and home.</p> \n<p><strong>Creosote buildup</strong>:<strong> </strong> Tar-like black creosote is a natural byproduct of lighting and maintaining a fire. However, if there's too much of it building up inside a fireplace, it could indicate there's a problem with the flue and that the chimney needs to be swept.</p> \n<p><strong>Flue damage</strong>: Flues can deteriorate subtly over time. If you notice pieces of chimney tile collecting in the fireplace (also known as shaling), advise your client to bring in a chimney professional.</p> \n<p><strong>Crown and cap damage</strong>: Small cracks along the crown and cap allow water to penetrate, where it contracts and expands during freezing and thawing and leads to much bigger damage. A vigilant roofing professional can fix these small cracks easily with masonry sealant. Larger chunks or damage will need to be addressed by a chimney expert.</p> \n<p><strong>Spalling or missing bricks</strong>: Bricks are porous, and are prone to contract and expand as a house ages. Loose bricks can be kept in place by masonry sealant. Any missing bricks should be replaced right away, either by a roofing contractor or a mason.</p> \n<p><strong>Damaged flashing</strong>: Bent flashing can cause moisture to penetrate the entire roof system. A skilled roofer can carefully remove existing roofing materials, fix and install new flashings and seal up and weatherproof the space between the roof and the chimney.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Chimney Repair Requires a Team Approach</h2> \n<p>Chimneys are complicated structures and require the input of several highly trained experts. Professional roofers must be prepared to work with masons, chimney sweeps and other contractors to ensure the integrity of a home's roof and chimney repair. Being able to count on other professionals will produce the best results and gives residential roofers a new way to help customers.</p>",

            "body": "<p>For workers new to commercial roofing, the avenues of advancement aren't always clear. The good news is that there's no shortage of continuing professional development choices for roofing contractors. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/roofers.htm#tab-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports that employment opportunities in roofing are expected to grow over twice the national rate for the next 10 years. This means that today's roofers will be in demand over the coming years. In order to make the best of that opportunity, you can advance your career by learning new skills or moving into an expanded role.</p> \n<h2>Specialty Roofing</h2> \n<p>Learning specialized skills is a classic route to career advancement. Government buildings, historic landmarks and houses of worship often call for specialists. Working on historical features such as spires or basilicas requires extensive knowledge of both trade craft and local regulations. The same is true for modern features like solar panels or rooftop gardens. Master the details of these niches by reading, talking to veteran roofers and getting hands-on experience. Before long, you'll be able to draw a higher paycheck for your expertise.</p> \n<h2>Project Management</h2> \n<p>One of the clearest paths for continuing professional development is moving from worker to project manager. Project management involves staying up to date with the latest in roofing technology, following any relevant changes to the <a href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/2018-i-codes/ibc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Building Code</a> and learning how to communicate effectively with the client. Running a project brings its own set of headaches, but if you enjoy solving puzzles and seeing a project come together, it's a fantastic next step in your career.</p> \n<h2>Sales</h2> \n<p>No roofing company will last long without a dependable pipeline of new jobs. Not everyone in sales has field experience, but crews are especially grateful to salespeople who do. Every commercial roof is different, and an experienced eye goes a long way when assessing a project. For example, a long-term care facility might seem straightforward, until you consider that their commercial kitchen vents grease-filled air to the roof, which can be a massive problem for materials such as EPDM.</p> \n<p>Salespeople who have spent time in the field have a deeper understanding of roofing details, and they tend to have fewer unanticipated issues with their projects.</p> \n<h2>Inspections, Maintenance and Customer Satisfaction</h2> \n<p>If you enjoy getting your hands dirty, roofing inspection and maintenance consultations offer a middle ground between jobsite work and paperwork.</p> \n<p>Inspections and maintenance calls unfold best when they're truly collaborative: contractors and property owners or facility managers working together to keep a property protected from the elements. The result is a mix of hands-on work and customer service.</p> \n<h2>Professional Networking</h2> \n<p>These are only a few options for continuing professional development in your roofing career. To find the path that's right for you, consider reaching out and talking to industry veterans. In other words, network!</p> \n<p>To some, networking sounds like an activity for bankers in suits. But it simply means treating people you work with well and making new friends. If you've ever cracked a joke with a vendor while picking up supplies, then you've been networking.</p> \n<p>No matter what level of activity you desire, commercial roofing is a field large enough to find a job that's perfect for you. Let professional contacts know that you're eager to learn, and doors will start to open. Organizations like <a href=\"https://nationalwomeninroofing.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Women in Roofing</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.nrca.net/education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Roofing Contractors Association</a> are great resources, but one of the best ways to make connections and learn about career opportunities is to ask your local distributor or sales rep. They have their finger on the pulse of the local industry, and can help connect you with other experts.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Accidents happen. And, when they do, they can be expensive and dangerous. When workers get hurt on the job or develop a work-related illness, your company can be held responsible. A workers' compensation plan helps you prepare for those unexpected accidents and protect your business at the same time. </p> \n<p>In most states, every business must have some form of workers' compensation. However, the laws vary, so make sure you know what is <a href=\"https://injury.findlaw.com/workers-compensation/workers-compensation-laws-by-state.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">required in your state</a> or province.</p> \n<h2>Protection Contractors Rely On</h2> \n<p>The employer, not the employee, pays for a workers' comp plan. A plan typically covers:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Medical expenses</strong> related to on-the-job injuries or work-related illnesses.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Lost wages</strong> (a portion of what your employee would have earned if they had been on the job).</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Legal fees</strong> if an employee files a lawsuit against your contracting business.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>States and provinces that mandate workers' comp generally agree to protect the rights of the employer and the employee. Employees are compensated for their medical expenses and a portion of their lost wages, but they give up the right to directly sue their employer for work-related injuries or illnesses. Employers also agree to cover employees with insurance that provides benefits in the case of a work-related injury or illness, limiting company liability. </p> \n<p>Keep in mind, notes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fieldpulse.com/academy/workers-compensation-contractors/\">Field Pulse</a>, in states where contractors don't have to provide <a href=\"https://www.fieldpulse.com/academy/workers-compensation-contractors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>this benefit, their companies are vulnerable to financially devastating lawsuits.</p> \n<h2>Who is Covered?</h2> \n<p>If you have four or more employees working for you, either full- or part-time, workers' comp is required and should cover full- and part-time employees, minors and sometimes subcontractors.</p> \n<p>Though workers' comp is available in all 50 states, it's best to check with your state agency or insurance provider about the local regulations that dictate which employees may be covered.</p> \n<p>If you're the sole proprietor, you may be exempt, but you should weigh your options. If you can show that you are doing the work of an employee of the company as well as owning and managing, you may be eligible for benefits. If you, as the business owner, are injured on the jobsite and cannot work, your health insurance should cover any medical costs. Ask your health insurance provider about this potential scenario.</p> \n<h2>What Factors Affect the Cost of Premiums?</h2> \n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all rate. Your premiums will be affected by many factors, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"\"><p><strong>Your employees' risk</strong>: Riskier contracting jobs usually have a higher rate.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\"><p><strong>Your annual payroll</strong>: This is used to calculate your annual insurance costs.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\"><p><strong>Your claims history:</strong> The number of claims you've had and the severity of the accidents can raise your premium.</p></li> \n <li class=\"\"><p><strong>Your location:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/10/09/343201.htm\">Higher-risk areas</a> usually have higher premiums.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The size of your crew and the overall insurance market at the time you obtain your policy may also influence prices.</p> \n<h2>What to Do When an Injury Happens</h2> \n<p>When someone has been injured, the first thing an owner or company should do is to make sure the injured employee receives immediate medical attention. Once the dust has settled, you'll need to complete and file a claim of the injury. Finally, you'll have to provide necessary documentation to your workers' comp insurance carrier.</p> \n<p>The amount employees will be compensated depends upon state laws, the severity of the injury and the time spent off work. According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.oshaeducationcenter.com/articles/workers-comp/\">OSHA Education Center</a>, workers' compensation is typically two thirds of a worker's wages at the time of the incident. No matter how large or small the injury, you may never fire or penalize an employee who has taken advantage of workers' comp.</p> \n<p>Safety training and personal protective equipment help keep your worksite safe, but they aren't enough to keep it accident-free. Even the most seasoned worker can fall prey to a work-related accident or illness. Workers' comp insurance protects your crew and your business.</p>",

            "KeyTakeaway": "Residential Contractors should learn some easy ways to help manage their family roofing business.",
            "title": "6 Tips for Roofers Managing a Family Business",
            "body": "<p>There are few things in this world as satisfying as successfully managing a family business. While it can be immensely rewarding, there's no shortage of pitfalls along the way since blending family and business produces a lot of tension. Here are six easy ways to run your family roofing business smoothly and leave the drama at home.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">1. Agree on Roles</h2> \n<p>Having a clear division of labor means you're less likely to step on each other's toes. Having clear decision-makers can also prevent the development of a \"management by committee\" mindset.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that as family members age, their roles might change. This is especially common when daughters, sons, nephews or nieces begin working for the family business, often starting as apprentice roofers before growing into leadership positions. Older family members, on the other hand, may transition from an active roofer role to a managerial or office position.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">2. Keep Work and Life Separated</h2> \n<p>Keeping work contained to working hours can take discipline. Luckily, an agreed-upon set of rules can make it harder to blur the lines between personal life and the jobsite. Something as simple as \"work doesn't cross the kitchen threshold\" can preserve meals as an oasis free from shoptalk.</p> \n<p>Whatever your method of separating work from personal time, experiment with ways to maintain those barriers, like using separate banks for home and business accounts, or silencing your phone at the same time every day. Once there's a crack in the dam, it's just a matter of time before the waters break through.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">3. Embrace Education</h2> \n<p>If you send your kids off to school or a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nrca.net/procertification/certifications\">certification program</a> to learn about the roofing industry, don't be offended when they return home full of new ideas and new ways of doing things. Book learning and practical experience work best when they work together. You can teach the younger generation how to install flashing or use a fall arrest harness, but they might teach you about solar roof tiles or aerial roof measuring software.</p> \n<p>Part of managing a family business is letting everyone feel that they're being heard. If you don't listen to your recent graduate's ideas, they'll grow increasingly frustrated, and you'll have spent a lot of money on tuition for no reason.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">4. Allow for Greener Grass</h2> \n<p>Some people are born wanting to work in the family roofing business; others need to try several occupations on for size before they find their calling. If a family member wants to spread their wings, don't fight them. Instead, let them know they'll be welcome back if they change their mind.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">5. Be Able to Walk Away</h2> \n<p>There comes a day when it's time to hand over the reins to another generation. Make that transition easier by building guidelines for everything from jobsite procedures to vendor relations. Then, educate your family members in their use. This will set them up for success when you're ready to step away.</p> \n<p>Stress-test these systems by taking a vacation and seeing how things run without your oversight. If your business can't run without your direct involvement, you might be sabotaging your successors.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">6. Put It in Writing</h2> \n<p>It's one thing to put together a plan over the dinner table, but it's another thing entirely to put it into place. This is especially true for events that won't happen for years or even decades to come. Put your succession plan in writing. When it comes time to sort out transfers of ownership or changes in management, having a written agreement ahead of time takes away a tremendous amount of pressure, and prevents uncertainty from growing in the minds of family members and employees.</p> \n<p>Whether you're starting a new family venture or you're the latest generation in a long line of ownership, do your best to provide operational clarity and give family members room to find their role in your roofing business. A few careful guidelines will help your business run smoother and keep the work-related stress out of your family gatherings.</p>",

            "title": "How to Increase Your Roofing Leads",
            "body": "<p>Traditionally, most roofing businesses have generated roofing leads using strategies like canvassing, door-to-door sales, direct mail, storm chasing, local television and trade shows. While these strategies still work on some level, they don't always reach people who are actively looking for your services. These interruption-based marketing strategies have become less effective at spreading the word as the noise level of marketing has increased for your customers.</p> \n<p>In addition, Business-to-Business (B2B) commercial roofing leads are infinitely more difficult to generate than remodeling contacts. Property owners have more specific needs and less time to talk than residential customers. Identifying and meeting these key decision-makers (and keeping them on through a long sales cycle) is tough when you are using telemarketing or canvassing methods.</p> \n<p>Here's a quick look at some different ways to generate effective roofing leads.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Boost Your Referrals With Sales</h2> \n<p>When asked how they generate leads, most roofing contractors will immediately point to referrals. Referral <em>marketing</em> can be a powerful tool — besides collecting the names of potential customers, this process involves analyzing leads and building a marketing structure around them.</p> \n<p>When there is sales involvement with a referral program, the conversion rate of the referral partner can be much higher than the industry standard. <a href=\"https://www.capterra.com/referral-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Referral marketing software</a> can help you get started.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Invest in Search</h2> \n<p>For contractors, it has become much <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/improve-google-rankings-contractor-marketing\">harder to rank</a> on a search result. Costs are rising for pay-per-click or search engine marketing. However, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/what-is-seo-and-how-it-works/\">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tempest.im/blog/voice-search/\">helps you perform well</a> in featured snippets, \"Near Me\" searches and voice search is worth looking into. Start with a robust, eye-catching website that includes strong <a href=\"https://grapevinemktg.com/seo-crosslinking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crosslinks</a> and links to relevant, authoritative outside sources.</p> \n<p>Strategic alliances with major roofing distributors and manufacturers are another option. Larger suppliers are spending millions on piggyback marketing and educational programs for contractors. Some services are provided free, while others may be based on a variety of criteria.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Explore Content Marketing</h2> \n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/\">Content Marketing Institute</a> defines this marketing field as the creation and distribution of \"valuable, relevant and consistent content [designed] to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.\"</p> \n<p>Instead of pitching your products or services, think about creating blog posts, materials checklists or other resources for property owners that help them solve their roofing problems. If a potential customer keeps coming back for your new posts, they may one day come back for a sale.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Don't Wait to Follow Up</h2> \n<p>One thing all of these strategies have in common is the need for quick follow-up. The contractor who responds first usually wins. Research from the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business Review</a> shows that companies that respond to web-submitted leads within an hour are 60 times more likely to land a sales conversation than companies that wait 24 hours or more.</p> \n<p>It often takes multiple attempts to make contact with web leads. Even if you do make contact, many of these leads don't convert immediately to appointments or sales. Teach your sales team to follow a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marketo.com/lead-nurturing/\">nurture marketing</a> strategy to be sure these valuable contacts aren't lost over time.</p> \n<p>Finding the best practices for each and every marketing channel requires an extraordinary time commitment and persistence. For roofing contractors, it is often best to hire a company that offers \"umbrella\" marketing coverage of the channels that work best for your business.</p> \n<p>No matter how you choose to generate roofing leads, approach the process like a face-to-face meeting: set clear objectives, have a proven script in mind, follow up and be prepared for anything!</p>",

            "title": "Understanding the Importance of Roof Pitch for Evaluating Your Roof",
            "body": "<p>You may not think one roof is altogether different from another, but there are many parameters that affect how your roof is structured and how it protects your home. Figuring out whether your house has a low-slope or steep-slope roof is an important factor in understanding how to replace or repair your roof.</p> \n<p>It's important to understand how roof pitch (also referred to as slope) should guide your roofing decisions, and what questions to ask your roofing contractor when it comes to pitch, materials and weather resistance.</p> \n<h2>Slope vs. Pitch: Not the Same</h2> \n<p>While the two terms are often used interchangeably, slope and pitch are not exactly the same thing. Think of slope as the steepness of the roof. Slope is calculated as the vertical rise (in inches) over the horizontal run (the distance from the center to the gutters in feet) and is usually expressed as a ratio. If a roof has a vertical rise of four inches and a run of 12 feet, the ratio would be 4:12. A low slope is closer to flat (horizontal), while a high slope is very steep. Low-slope roofs are generally pitches of 3:12 or less, while steep-slope roofs are 4:12 or greater.</p> \n<p>The pitch is the incline of the roof. It's the measurement of the roof's rise to its span (the distance across the entire building) and is expressed as a fraction. If a roof rises 4 feet over a 24-foot span, it would be reduced to 1 to 6, or 1/6.</p> \n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nachi.org/roof-slope-pitch.htm\">International Association of Certified Home Inspectors</a> offers a helpful diagram of these measurements, along with more information on <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/roof-slope-pitch.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>how to measure slope and pitch.</p> \n<h2>The Link Between Your Roof and Your Climate</h2> \n<p>The pitch of the roof also plays a part in how well the roof protects the house from rain, wind, sun and snow. A higher-pitched roof, such as a gable roof, sheds water, snow and ice easily but is more susceptible to damage from high winds. </p> \n<p>With a low-sloped or flat roof, more water will collect and pool on the roof. This type of roof is not ideal for areas that get a lot of rain or heavy snowfall.</p> \n<h2>How Does Roof Pitch Affect What Materials Can Be Used?</h2> \n<p>In general, steep pitches use more materials to cover the roof's surface, and may require more or specialized labor, which drives up costs.</p> \n<p>Asphalt shingles, the most common roofing material, can be used on roof slopes of 4:12 or greater using standard application methods. Asphalt shingles may be used on roofs with slopes of less than 4:12, but only if special low-slope application procedures are followed.</p> \n<p>Low-slope roofs typically need a rubber membrane or metal roofing system to ensure that the roof will not leak if standing water collects on the surface.</p> \n<h2>Homeowner's Homework: Questions to Ask</h2> \n<p>To further understand the implications of your particular roof pitch, here are some questions you should ask your roofing contractor:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is the pitch of my roof?</li> \n <li>Do I have the proper runoff for my roof, or will I need to take additional steps?</li> \n <li>How does my roof pitch impact the materials we can use?</li> \n <li>How will it impact the price?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Determining your roof pitch doesn't have to be a major math challenge. A trusted roofing contractor can tell you exactly what type of roof you have and recommend the best materials for your home.</p>",

            "title": "Skylight Pros and Cons: Should You Add Skylights to Your Home?",
            "body": "<p>If the interior of your home is a little dark, you have a few options when it comes to brightening things up. You can get clever with your lighting. You can paint the walls white. Or you can find ways to let more light in, such as by adding a skylight. Learn some skylight pros and cons to see if installing one is a good option for your home.</p> \n<h2>Skylights Can Lower (or Raise) Your Energy Bills</h2> \n<p>A skylight is essentially a window that's located on the roof. Some skylights open, others don't. Skylights also vary in terms of size, angle and positioning. How the skylight is installed can influence how effectively it lets in light or warmth and how much it is able to help you save money.</p> \n<p>Making the interior of your home brighter may mean that you need to turn fewer lights on during the daytime and could end up with a lower electric bill. Since a skylight can also let in warmth from the sun, it can mean that you don't need to turn your thermostat up so high in the winter to keep your home cozy. That can lead to a reduced heating bill.</p> \n<p>However, a skylight could also potentially have a negative impact on your home's energy bill. Depending on where the skylight is positioned on your roof, it can let in too much sunlight, making your home too warm and causing you to crank up the air conditioning. In the winter, it's possible for heat to escape through the skylight.</p> \n<p>To make the most of heat gain from your skylight, the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/design/windows-doors-and-skylights/skylights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Department of Energy</a> recommends installing your home's skylights at a slope that is 5 to 15 degrees more than the geographic latitude of your home. If your house is located at 40 degrees latitude, for example, your skylights should be placed on your roof at a 45 to 55-degree angle.</p> \n<h2>Skylights Can Improve Ventilation</h2> \n<p>Heat rises, which means that warm air has a tendency to get stuck at the top of your home. If you install a skylight that can open, you can improve the ventilation in your home by opening the skylight and giving the hot air a chance to escape.</p> \n<p>If you do want to install a skylight to improve ventilation, it's worth giving some thought to how it will open. You might find that having to open your skylight manually with a pole or crank is a bit of a hassle. For that reason, you might prefer a model that opens with the help of an electric motor and the push of a button.</p> \n<h2>Proper Installation Is a Must</h2> \n<p>A skylight is only going to deliver the greatest benefits (and the fewest problems) if it's installed correctly. Proper installation means choosing an appropriate spot and making sure the skylight is positioned to minimize the risk of moisture damage or leaks.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/design/windows-doors-and-skylights/skylights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Department of Energy</a>, mounting your skylight above the roof surface and installing a <a href=\"https://www.creators.com/read/heres-how/11/18/properly-build-a-curb-and-flash-a-skylight-87747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">curb and flashing</a> will help to prevent leaks. It's a good idea to work with a professional roofing contractor to make sure the skylight is properly installed.</p> \n<h2>Is the Cost of a Skylight Worth It?</h2> \n<p>One last thing to consider when it comes to skylight pros and cons is the cost. On the positive side, skylights themselves are pretty affordable, with the most expensive models costing around $500, according to <a href=\"https://www.houselogic.com/remodel/windows-doors-and-floors/skylight-installation-costs-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HouseLogic</a>. On the negative side, installation costs can reach up to $3,000. It's up to you to decide if the benefits of having a skylight, such as improved ventilation, better lighting and lower energy bills, are worth the expense.</p> \n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;\"> \n <h4 style=\"box-sizing: initial; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Calibri, 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Trebuchet MS', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.2; color: #777777; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 7px; background-color: #ffffff;\">skylight pros and cons</h4> \n</div>",

            "body": "<p>Not all homeowners understand the complexities of roofing ventilation, and some may try to cut corners if faced with a sizable work estimate. Roofing contractors who emphasize the value of proper roof ventilation are doing their customers a significant service.</p> \n<p>By illustrating the benefits of proper ventilation — and the structural issues that arise when ventilation is faulty — you can provide a big-picture view that demonstrates the importance of this element to your residential roofing clients.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Key Benefits of Ventilation</h2> \n<p>Ventilation helps regulate temperatures in a home's attic, which in turn helps control temperatures throughout the house. Attic ventilation plays a key role in keeping a home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.</p> \n<p>If they don't know already, you should tell your clients that proper roof ventilation:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"\">Keeps moisture from accumulating, which prevents condensation problems, mold and mildew.</li> \n <li class=\"\">Averts excessive heat buildup, which keeps home heating costs lower <em>and </em>reduces the likelihood of early shingle deterioration.</li> \n <li class=\"\">Maintains the life span and quality of a roof year-round.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 class=\"\">What Happens With Poor Ventilation</h2> \n<p>When an attic is improperly ventilated, it can overheat and damage roof shingles. Excess heat in the house can warp wood framing in walls and doors, and even blister paint and wallpaper.</p> \n<p>Moisture buildup from poor ventilation can be a serious problem. Resulting mold and mildew not only triggers structural harm, it also can affect the health of people who suffer from asthma or allergies.</p> \n<p>In the winter, ice dams can form when poorly ventilated attics lead to snow melting on the roof and refreezing along the eaves. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/protecting-home-rain-and-ice/dealing-and-preventing-ice-dams\">Leakage behind an ice dam</a> can damage ceilings, walls and insulation.</p> \n<p>All of these factors should be described in detail to homeowners to help them picture the consequences of poor ventilation.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Adhering to Industry Standards</h2> \n<p class=\"\">According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aibd.org/blog/top-five-attic-ventilation-faqs/\" rel=\"noopener\">American Institute of Building Design</a>, the international standard for home ventilation is a minimum of 1 square foot of ventilation for every 150 square feet of attic floor space. Some U.S. sources recommend only 1 square foot of ventilation for every 300 square feet of attic floor space. Either way, ventilation should consist of equal parts intake vents and exhaust vents.</p> \n<p>The amount of ventilation a home needs also depends on its structure, including ridge heights. Check with your shingle manufacturer and suppliers for their ventilation standards.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">What to Tell Homeowners About Roof Ventilation</h2> \n<p>As a skilled roofing contractor, you are your customers' most important source of knowledge when it comes to maintaining proper ventilation. Offering valuable tips and insights on this subject helps build customer loyalty over the long run.</p> \n<p>Even if you're not installing a new roof and ventilation system tomorrow, you can advise homeowners about how to check for indications of poorly or under-ventilated attics. Your tips might include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do a visual inspection at least twice a year. Look for cracks, patches, damaged or missing shingles and detached gutters.</li> \n <li>Keep vents to the outside clear of ice and debris, particularly during (or just after) a snowstorm.</li> \n <li>Make sure the attic has sufficient insulation that is free from mold or deterioration.</li> \n <li>Check the attic vents to the outside periodically, and place screens over the vents to prevent animals from nesting inside them or scurrying into your attic.</li> \n <li>After a big storm, walk around the inside and outside of the house to check for any indication of internal or external water damage.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Remind your customers that their best line of attack against poor ventilation is to seek help from a seasoned roofing contractor.</p>",

            "title": "Green Roof Benefits and Barriers for Commercial Contractors",
            "body": "<p>The green roof benefits for property owners, local municipalities and the environment are well documented. But what about the green roof benefits for commercial roofing contractors? One thing is for sure: proposing a green roofing solution to the right owner can win the bid for a skilled roofing professional, along with public recognition from neighbors and environmental groups.</p> \n<p>Green, or vegetated, roofs used to be feasible only for larger, diversified contractors or specialists, but new technologies are opening up the market. Over the <a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-governmentwide-policy/office-of-federal-highperformance-buildings/resource-library/integrative-strategies/green-roofs/green-roof-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last 20 years</a>, more green roofs have sprouted up across the U.S. and installation options have become more workable for the average roofing contractor.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Green Roof Pros and Cons</h2> \n<p>From a multi-acre project to a small patio, a green roof project requires a contractor to deal with potentially unfamiliar components, such as drainage systems, water retention and filtration, root edging and plants. Waterproofing is even more critical than on an ordinary membrane roof project.</p> \n<p>Growing and irrigating plants on the surface of a roof seems counter-intuitive to contractors who have spent the better part of their lives keeping water <em>off</em> the roof. But green roofs can play an important role in capturing and detaining storm water. During hot and dry spells, saturating a green roof is imperative. Green roofs are slowly weaned off irrigation, and the vegetation should become self-sustaining within the first year.</p> \n<p>It's also important to cover as much of the total roof area with plantings as possible. Exposed roof membrane may age faster and weaken the transition areas between the plantings.</p> \n<p>The initial expense for a green roof installation can be <a href=\"https://www.hunker.com/12003790/disadvantages-of-green-roofs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twice the cost</a> of a traditional roof. However, with proper maintenance, a green roof can <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tps/sustainability/new-technology/green-roofs/benefits.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">double the system's life expectancy</a>. Considering that many property owners pay little attention to their roofs after installation, certain maintenance protocols (from hand-weeding to approved weedkillers) must be agreed upon in writing as part of the guarantee process. That's why the most successful contractors team up with a green roofing manufacturer, distributor or outside specialist.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Staten Island Goes Green</h2> \n<p>The Empire Outlets mall in Staten Island, New York is a good example of a green roofing success story. At 2.5 acres, it is the largest green roof in Staten Island and illustrates the teamwork required to execute a green roof of this size.</p> \n<p>\"The project was successful because of the team that worked with us,\" says Michael Kaspar, the New York/New Jersey regional commercial president for Allied Building Products. \"A commercial contractor needs a great estimating team to win the project, [and] a project manager to learn how to install the new product line while leveraging a green roof manufacturer.\"</p> \n<p>Columbia Green Technologies of Portland, Oregon helped contractors complete the mall project in a record 6 months by working with Allied Building Products to supply materials on time and advise contractors on the installation process. Few distributors can handle a project of this size where the supplier is located clear across the country. But, Kaspar says, relationships matter: \"utilizing a familiar distribution company will ensure that your project runs smoothly from a logistics standpoint and meets your timeline.\"</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Branching Out</h2> \n<p>According to Kaspar, contractors should partner with a green roof manufacturer that can supply the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Appropriate plants for your region.</li> \n <li>Growing media that meets the roof's specifications.</li> \n <li>Guidelines on wind and weight requirements.</li> \n <li>Storm water calculations.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Laying the green roof itself is not complicated. However, site conditions, complex job sequencing, loading and hoisting, and worker safety issues can pose serious risks for an inexperienced company. Kaspar recommends choosing a green roof that can be installed in pre-made components — a method he calls the \"Lego\" approach. This offers the property owner a roof that \"has built-in irrigation and will be green on day one.\"</p> \n<p>Many roofing and construction professionals are still skeptical of green roof benefits, but more architects, developers and urban planners are viewing these roofs as a key feature of modern construction. With a reliable green roofing manufacturer as a partner, the barriers to this new frontier may not be as high as most contractors think.</p>",

            "body": "<p>A well-designed roof can be the crown of any home. Not only does it look appealing — it also enhances your home's energy efficiency, longevity and sustainability.</p> \n<p>To select the right types of roof shingles for your home, you should carefully evaluate the pros and cons of a few common material choices, including asphalt, metal, tiles and slate.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Asphalt: Popular and Affordable</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/roofing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Green Builder Magazine</a> reports that asphalt leads the pack as a roof choice, making up 83 percent of the residential market share. Made from fiberglass sandwiched between asphalt and ceramic granules, the shingles are affordable and relatively easy to install. A variety of colors and textures are available, although your color choice is limited to darker hues due to the color of the surface granules.</p> \n<p>Asphalt does not have the longevity of other types of shingles. Most products last 15 to 20 years before they need to be replaced. Laminated asphalt, on the other hand, can survive 25 to 30 years and is more suitable for hurricane-prone coastal regions, according to the market research firm <a href=\"https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/residential-roofing-3436.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Freedonia Group</a>.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Sustainable Metal</h2> \n<p class=\"\">Metal roofs are far more eco-friendly compared to other types of roof shingles. They are completely recyclable and can last more than 50 years. According to Green Builder Magazine, metal roofs can be sealed with cool roof finishes, which reduce heat absorption by as much as 36 percent. (That's a big discount on your air conditioning bill in the summer.)</p> \n<p>At half the weight of asphalt, metal is also easy to install, durable and water resistant. However, it is often more costly. <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/metal-roof-vs-asphalt-shingle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Advisor</a> reports that metal roofing material can cost one and a half to three times more per square foot than asphalt. The installation cost for a 1,500-square-foot metal roof can be up to double the price of installing the same size asphalt roof.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Tiles and Slate</h2> \n<p>Similar to metal, clay and concrete tiles can last more than 50 years, and are a low-maintenance, highly durable roofing material. However, heavy masonry is a more expensive product and can be challenging to install. Green Builder Magazine suggests that these qualities make it more suitable for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/roofing/install-replace-tile-roof/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/roofing/install-replace-tile-roof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regional styles</a> and high-end housing.</p> \n<p>Slate is a major financial commitment, but that investment comes with a highly durable roof that may last for over a century. Slate roofs can be very beautiful and often lend your home a higher resale value.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.roofingcalc.com/slate-roofing-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roofing Calculator</a> points out that since slate is a natural stone, it's waterproof and impervious to fungus and mold. It's also highly resistant to temperature fluctuations and extreme weather.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, slate makes for a very heavy roof. Find out if your house can structurally support a slate roof before you consider this option. Additionally, slate installation is complex and requires an experienced contractor who specializes in slate roofing.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Setting Priorities</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, homeowners need to prioritize the most important aspects of their new roof when choosing a roofing material. Are your main concerns cost and longevity, or do you need a durable roof that will last through ice storms or hurricane season? Maybe you want to splurge on aesthetics or potential home resale value. With a little research and a carefully crafted list of priorities, you can make an educated choice for your home.</p>",

A succession plan helps the company flourish without the present owner by moving current managers into leadership and eventual ownership.</p> \n<p>Transferring ownership of your roofing business should always involve a customized, written plan. A straightforward exit plan monetizes the business and moves the owner into the next stage of life with their wealth intact. A plan for succession focuses more on the human side of the business: choosing the next generation of leaders and laying out their professional development. This requires time, training and an honest assessment of your team's blind spots.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Put Your Plan in Writing</h2> \n<p>In Kennedy's view, owners must first consider an exit process that will meet their personal and financial goals. Once the owner has examined their options, they can start identifying who will be the next leaders of the organization. It's not unusual for a succession plan to take several months to write, and several years to execute. Kennedy is quick to admit that his own exit plan took seven years and cost the company $250,000.</p> \n<p>Setting up a thriving roofing company to run without the owner can be a delicate task. Depending on the readiness of the management and current payout, a succession plan may run from three to 10 years. On the other hand, an <a href=\"https://www.theroofershelper.com/choosing-roofing-company-business-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">organized company</a> with tidy financial records and mature managers could be ready to sell in less than a year.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Tax Considerations</h2> \n<p>A structured management buyout (MBO) is the most common exit for contractors. It can also be the most tax efficient:</p> \n<ul type=\"disc\"> \n <li>The company pays for everything.</li> \n <li>You buy yourself out with company profits.</li> \n <li>The owner has \"pre-saved\" for retirement in deductible, tax-efficient methods.</li> \n <li>Buyers can be family members or employees.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The largest obstacle in executing an MBO is that managers often don't have the cash to pay for the business. This requires the owner to structure a plan that will let the business pay for the transition by understanding the value of the company, negotiating sale prices and managing risks to protect company assets. The good news is that your future cash flow will pay for most expenses and your managers will drive the profits.The owner may still need to pay capital gains and state tax on the sale of any stock.</p> \n<p>A contractor should also start preparing the family member or manager who will run the business as early as possible, since leadership skills take time to learn. If you choose your successor carefully and set them up with a written transition plan, you can go into retirement knowing that your life's work is in good hands.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Every year for the past five years, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has hosted the <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/StopFallsStandDown/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Safety Stand-Down to Prevent Falls in Construction</a> to raise awareness of one of the leading causes of death in the construction industry: falls. Construction crews across the country can participate in a stand-down by taking the time to talk about fall fatalities and injuries.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://stats.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm#2012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, fatal falls decreased from 384 in 2016 to 366 in 2017. However, OSHA maintains that those deaths were preventable. Taking a break in the workday to talk about your<a href=\"https://www.beaconroofingsupply.com/Safety.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> commitment to safety</a> can help you and your crew eliminate or reduce risky behaviors and safely handle workplace hazards.</p> \n<p>This year's National Safety Stand-Down will take place May 6-10, but safety is a year-round concern. Whether you join in that week or pick another day to circle up with your crew, here are a few ways to make sure your workforce is taking the necessary precautions to prevent falls.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Easy Steps to Ensure Jobsite Safety</h2> \n<p>Some of OSHA's most important tips for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpowg5Ynh0w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">preventing workplace falls</a> apply to both commercial and residential contractors.</p> \n<p>For the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/fallprotection/\">construction industry</a>, OSHA requires that workers use approved fall protection equipment when working at a height of 6 feet or more. Select your equipment based on the different hazards workers may encounter on a roofing job, such skylights, holes or uneven ledges. A <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/construction/falls/fallarrest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal fall arrest system</a> (PFAS) with a harness and secure anchorage is the surest way to stop a worker's fall. Rope grabs allow roofers to adjust the length of the lifeline rope, giving them more flexibility on the job.</p> \n<p>Your fall protection equipment should suit the work at each jobsite. This includes providing not only the right PFAS, but also the right kinds of ladders, scaffolds, guardrails and other equipment. The key to effective personal protective equipment is ensuring each person is trained on the proper setup, fit and use of each type of safety gear.</p> \n<p>Inspect your PFAS equipment — your harness, lanyard and anchorage point — before each use. This is true of all fall protection equipment, so give your ladder a once-over, too. You want to make sure everything is in good working condition for a safe use, every time.</p> \n<h2 class=\"\">Safety Habits You Can Start Today</h2> \n<p>Besides using proper equipment, the National Safety Stand-Down can be a good opportunity to start a few other safety traditions:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Take time for \"Toolbox Talks.\"</strong> An informal safety meeting before your crew gets started for the day can be an effective way to reinforce safety protocols. Cover any potential safety hazards on the jobsite and ensure each worker has the right protective equipment.</li> \n <li><strong>Conduct safety equipment inspections</strong>. Have more experienced workers help less seasoned roofers ensure they have the right equipment, and that it is in good working condition and safe to use.</li> \n <li><strong>Start the day with worksite walk-arounds</strong>. Have everyone on your crew take a walk around the jobsite prior to the start of work. Identify fall and other hazards that everyone — particularly roofers — should to be aware of. One person may see hazards another doesn't, so ask everyone on the crew to speak up about what they notice.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Finally, consider conducting your own safety stand-down or participating in one near you. It doesn't matter how big your business is — any number of people can hold a stand-down.</p> \n<p>Remember: Fall protection can save lives. Emphasizing the importance of fall prevention on every jobsite can help your crew look out for each other and use the right safety equipment.</p>",
